\label{sec:marker}

\madbox{
label: MARKER;
}
The simplest element which can occur in a beam line is the MARKER. It
has no effect on the beam, but it allows one to identify a position in
the beam line, for example to apply a matching constraint.  

{\bf Example:}
\madxmp{M27: MARKER;}


\section{Drift Space}
\ttindex{drift}
\label{sec:drift}

\madbox{
label: DRIFT, L=real;
}

A drift space has one real attribute: 
\begin{madlist}
   \ttitem{L} The drift length (Default: 0 m) 
\end{madlist}

{\bf Example: }
\madxmp{
DR1: \= DRIFT, \= L = 1.5; \\
DR2: \> DRIFT, \> L = DR1->L;
}

The length of DR2 will always be equal to the length of DR1. The
\hyperref[subsec:local_straight]{straight reference system} for a drift
space is a cartesian coordinate system.   


\section{Bending Magnets}
\ttindex{bend}
\label{sec:bend}
Two different type keywords are recognised for bending magnets, they are
distinguished only by the reference system used:  
\begin{madlist}
  \ttitem{SBEND}\label{bend_sbend} is a sector bending magnet. \\
  The planes of the pole faces intersect at the centre of curvature of
  the curved 
  % Its pole faces meet at the centre of curvature of the curved
  \hyperref[subsec:local_rbend]{sbend reference system}.  
  \ttitem{RBEND}\label{bend_rbend} is a rectangular bending magnet. \\ 
  The pole faces are parallel. The reference system is the curved  
  % It has parallel pole faces and is based on a curved
  \hyperref[subsec:local_rbend]{rbend reference system}.
\end{madlist}

Bendig magnets are defined by the statements: 
\madbox{
label: SBEND, \= L = real, ANGLE = real, TILT = real, \\
              \> K0 = real, K1 = real, K2 = real, \\
              \> E1 = real, E2 = real, FINT = real, FINTX = real,\\ 
              \> HGAP = real, H1 = real, H2 = real,\\
              \> THICK = logical;\\[5mm]

label: RBEND, \> L = real, ANGLE = real, TILT = real, \\
              \> K0 = real, K1 = real, K2 = real, \\
              \> E1 = real, E2 = real, FINT = real, FINTX = real, \\
              \> HGAP = real, H1 = real, H2 = real, \\
              \> THICK = logical, \\
              \> ADD\_ANGLE='array';
}

Bending magnets have the following attributes:
\begin{madlist}
   \ttitem{L} The length of the magnet (default: 0 m). \\
   For sector bends the declared length is the arc length 
   of the reference orbit. \\
   For rectangular bends the declared length is normally the length of a
   straight line joining the entry and exit points, as in the
   Figure. \\ 
   Internally \madx only uses the arc length of the reference orbit for
   both bend types.\\ 
   {\bf In order to define RBEND's with a declared length equal to the
     arc length of the reference orbit, the option RBARC must be
     previously set to FALSE in \madx with {\tt Option, RBARC= false;}} 
   
   \ttitem{ANGLE} The bend angle (default: 0 rad). \\ 
   A positive bend angle represents a bend to the right, i.e. towards
   negative \texttt{x} values.  
   
   \ttitem{ADD\_ANGLE} An array of (maximum 5) bending angles for
   multiple passes. See \texttt{add\_pass} option of the
   \href{sequence.html}{sequence} command. This is only allowed for
   RBEND elements and is ignored for SBEND elements. 
 
   \ttitem{TILT} The roll angle about the longitudinal axis (default: 0
   rad, i.e. a horizontal bend). \\ 
   A positive angle represents a clockwise rotation. \\ 
   An attribute TILT=pi/2 turns a
   horizontal into a vertical bend, and a positive ANGLE then denotes a
   downwards deflection.

   %% \textbf{ Please note that contrary to \madeight one has to specify
   %%   the desired TILT angle, otherwise it is taken as 0 rad. This was
   %%   needed to avoid the confusion in \madeight about the actual meaning of
   %%   the TILT attribute for various elements. } 

   \ttitem{K1} The quadrupole coefficient (Default: $0 mˆ{-2}$)\\
     $K_1 = (1/B\rho) (\partial B_y / \partial x)$. \\
     A positive quadrupole strength implies horizontal focussing of
     positively charged particles.  

   \ttitem{E1} The rotation angle for the entrance pole face (Default: 0 rad). 
   \ttitem{E2} The rotation angle for the exit pole face (Default: 0 rad). \\
   The pole face rotation angles are referred to the magnet model for
   \href{local_system.html#rbend}{rectangular bend} and
   \href{local_system.html#sbend}{sector bend} respectively. \\
   E1 and E2 are positive if they reduce the length of the
   side of the bend that is further away from the centre of
   curvature. \\
   E1 and E2 must be specified as positive to give an SBEND parallel
   faces, ie turning it into an RBEND. E1 and E2 must be negative to
   give an RBEND faces whose planes intersect at the centrer of
   curvature, ie turning it into an SBEND. 

   \ttitem{FINT} The fringe field integral at entrance and exit of the
   bend. (Default:  0). 
   \ttitem{FINTX} If defined and positive, the fringe field integral at
   the exit of the element, overriding FINT for the exit. (Default: =FINT) \\ 
   This allows to set different fringe field integrals at entrance
   (FINT) and exit (FINTX) of the element.  

   \ttitem{HGAP} The half gap of the magnet (default: 0 m). 

   \ttitem{K2}\index{K2} The sextupole coefficient. (Default: $0
   mˆ{-3}$) \\ $K_2 = (1/B\rho) (\partial^2 B_y / \partial x^2)$.   

   \ttitem{H1}\index{H1} The curvature of the entrance pole
   face. (Default: $0 m^{-1}$).   
   \ttitem{H2} The curvature of the exit pole face. (Default: $0
   m^{-1}$). \\  
   A positive pole face curvature induces a negative sextupole
   component; i.e. for positive H1 and H2 the centres of curvature of
   the pole faces are placed inside the magnet. 

   \ttitem{K0} {\bf OBSOLETE} \\
   Please take note that K$_0$ and K$_0s$ are left in the
   data base but are no longer used for the MAP of the bends,
   instead ANGLE and TILT are used exclusively. \\
   %% We believe that this will allow for a clearer and
   %% unambiguous definition, in particular in view of the upcoming
   %% integration of \madx with PTC which will allow a more general
   %% definition of bends.  
   However, specifying K0 is required in order to be able to assign RELATIVE 
   field errors to a bending magnet because K0 is used for the normalization 
   instead of the ANGLE. (see EFCOMP).\\
   With $K_0 = (1 / B \rho) B_y$, one gets K0 = ANGLE / arclength.

% -K0: 
% -The horizontal dipole coefficient 
% -<i>K<sub>0</sub> = (1 / B rho) B<sub>y</sub> </i>. 
% -The default is 0 m<sup>-1</sup>. 
% -A positive dipole strength is equivalent to a positive ANGLE which has the 
% -precedence over K<sub>0</sub>; however, if ANGLE is omitted,  
% -K<sub>0</sub>*L is used instead. 
% -K0S: 
% -The vertical dipole coefficient 
% -<i>K<sub>0s</sub> = (1 / B rho) B<sub>x</sub> </i>. 
% -The default is 0 m<sup>-1</sup>. A positive K0S deflects the closed 
% -orbit to positive y values.

   \ttitem{THICK} If this logical flag is set to true the bending 
   magnet will be tracked through as a thick-element, instead of being
   converted into thin-lenses. \\
   (Default: false)
\end{madlist}

{\bf Note:} Additional attributes can be given to bending magnets that
are useful for PTC and defined in \ref{sec:add_option_PTC}.

\vskip 5mm
{\bf \underline{Fringe Fields:}}
\vskip 3mm
The quantities FINT and HGAP specify the finite extent of the fringe
fields as defined in SLAC-75 \cite{slac75}:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{FINT}=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{B_y(s)(B_0-B_y(s))}{g \cdot
  B_0^2}\,\mathrm{d}s ,\quad\quad g=2\cdot \mathrm{HGAP}. 
\end{equation}

The default values of zero corresponds to the hard-edge approximation,
i.e. a rectangular field distribution. For other approximations, enter
the correct value of the half gap, and one of the following values for
FINT: 
 
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l l}
    Linear Field drop-off                   &  1/6 \\
    Clamped "Rogowski" fringing field       &  0.4 \\
    Unclamped "Rogowski" fringing field     &  0.7 \\
    "Square-edged" non-saturating magnet    &  0.45
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}


Entering the keyword FINT alone sets the integral to 0.5, which is a
reasonable average of the above values.  

Note also that the possibility to specify both FINT and FINTX  allows
one to set different values at entrance and exit of a bend element. \\ 
This can be particularly useful to set the fringe field integral to zero
on one side only, e.g. when slicing a dipole.  


{\bf \underline {Examples:}}
\madxmp{
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\= \kill
BR: RBEND, L=5., ANGLE=+0.001;             \>! Deflection to the right \\
BD: RBEND, L=5., ANGLE=+0.001, TILT=pi/2;  \>! Deflection down \\
BL: RBEND, L=5., ANGLE=+0.001, TILT=pi;    \>! Deflection to the left \\
BU: RBEND, L=5., ANGLE=+0.001, TILT=-pi/2; \>! Deflection up
}



\section{Dipedge Element}
\ttindex{dipedge}
\label{sec:dipedge}

A thin element describing the edge focusing of a dipole has been
introduced in order to make it possible to track trajectories in the
presence of dipoles with pole face angles. Only linear terms are
considered since the higher order terms would make the tracking
non-symplectic. The transformation of the machine elements into thin
lenses leaves dipedge untouched and splits correctly the SBENDS's.  

It does not make sense to use it alone. It can be specified at the
entrance and the exit of a SBEND. They are defined by the commands:  
\madbox{
label: DIPEDGE, H=real, E1=real, FINT=real, HGAP=real, TILT=real;
}

A DIPEDGE has zero length and five attributes. 
\begin{madlist}
   \ttitem{H} Is angle/length or 1/rho (default: 0 m$^{-1}$ - for the
     default the dipedge element has no effect). (must be equal to that
     of the associated SBEND)  
   \ttitem{E1} The rotation angle for the pole face.The sign convention is
     as for a SBEND \href{bend.html}{Bending Magnet}. Note that it is
     different for an entrance and an exit. (default: 0 rad).  
   \ttitem{FINT} field integral as for SBEND
     \href{local_system.html#sbend}{sector bend}. Note that each dipedge
     has its own fint, so fintx is no longer necessary.  
   \ttitem{HGAP} half gap height of the associated SBEND
     \href{bend.html}{Bending Magnet}.   
   \ttitem{TILT} The roll angle about the longitudinal axis (default: 0
     rad, i.e. a horizontal bend). A positive angle represents a
     clockwise rotation.  
\end{madlist}

\section{Quadrupole}
\ttindex{quadrupole}
\label{sec:quadrupole}

\madbox{
label: QUADRUPOLE, \= L = real, K1 = real, K1S = real, TILT = real,\\
                   \> THICK = logical;
}


A QUADRUPOLE has five attributes:     
\begin{madlist}
   \ttitem{L} The quadrupole length (default: 0 m). 
   \ttitem{K1} The normal quadrupole coefficient:        
     $K_1 = 1/(B \rho) (\partial B_y / \partial x)$.\\ 
     The default is $0 m^{-2}$. A positive normal quadrupole strength
     implies horizontal focussing of positively charged particles.  
   \ttitem{K1S} The skew quadrupole coefficient 
     $K_{1s} = 1/(2 B \rho) (\partial B_x / \partial x - \partial B_y / \partial y)$\\  
     where (x,y) is now a coordinate system rotated by $-45^\circ$ around s
     with respect to the normal one. The default is 0  m**(-2). A
     positive skew quadrupole strength implies defocussing (!) of
     positively charged particles in the (x,s) plane rotated by 45$^o$
     around s (particles in this plane have x = y $>$ 0). 
   \ttitem{TILT} The roll angle about the longitudinal axis (default: 0
     rad, i.e. a normal quadrupole). A positive angle represents a
     clockwise rotation. A TILT=pi/4 turns a positive normal quadrupole
     into a negative skew quadrupole.          

\textbf{Please note that contrary to \madeight one has to
  specify the desired TILT angle, otherwise it is taken as
  0 rad. This was needed to avoid the confusion in \madeight
  about the actual meaning of the TILT attribute for
  various elements. } 

    \ttitem{THICK} If this logical flag is set to true the quadrupole
    will be tracked through as a thick-element, instead of being
    converted into thin-lenses.\\
    (Default: false)
\end{madlist}

\textbf{Note also that $K_1$ or $K_{1s}$ can be considered as
  the normal or skew quadrupole components of the magnet on
  the bench, while the TILT attribute can be considered as a
  tilt alignment error in the machine. In fact, a positive
  $K_1$ with a $\tt{TILT} = 0$ is equivalent to a positive $K_{1s}$
  with positive $\tt{TILT} = +\pi/4$ } 

Example:

A {\tt SEXTUPOLE} has four real attributes:

      (default: $0 m^{-3}$).

      $K_{2S} = \frac{1}{B \rho} (\partial^2 B_x / \partial x^2)$ \\

      where (x,y) is now a coordinate system rotated by $-30^\circ$ around s with
      respect to the normal one. (default: $0 m^{-3}$). A positive skew
      sextupole strength implies defocussing (!) of positively charged
      particles in the (x,s) plane rotated by $30\deg$ around s (particles in
      this plane have $x > 0$, $y > 0$).  

    \ttitem{TILT} The roll angle about the longitudinal axis (default: 0
      rad, i.e. a normal sextupole). A positive angle represents a
      clockwise rotation. A $\tt{TILT} = \pi/6$ turns a positive normal sextupole
      into a negative skew sextupole.
      
      \textbf{  Please note that contrary to \madeight one has to specify the

An {\tt OCTUPOLE} has four real attributes: 
\begin{madlist}
   \ttitem{L} The octupole length (default: 0 m). 

   \ttitem{K3} The normal octupole coefficient 
     $K_3 = \frac{1}{B \rho} (\partial^3B_y / \partial x^3)$ \\

%% K2S for sextupoles 
     $K_{3S} = \frac{1}{2 B\rho} (\partial^3B_x/\partial x^3 -

     where (x,y) is now a coordinate system rotated by -22.5$^o$ around
     s with respect to the normal one. (default: $0 m^{-4}$). A positive
     skew octupole strength implies defocussing (!) of positively
     charged particles in the (x,s) plane rotated by 22.5$^o$ around s
     (particles in this plane have x $>$ 0, y $>$ 0).  

   \ttitem{TILT} The roll angle about the longitudinal axis (default: 0
     rad, i.e. a normal octupole). A positive angle represents a
     clockwise rotation. A TILT=pi/8 turns a positive normal octupole
     into a negative skew octupole.  

     \textbf{Please note that contrary to \madeight one has to specify the
       desired TILT angle, otherwise it is taken as 0 rad. This was
       needed to avoid the confusion in \madeight about the actual meaning of
       the TILT attribute for various elements. }

\end{madlist}

\textbf{Note also that $K_3$ or $K_{3S}$ can be considered as the normal or
  skew quadrupole components of the magnet on the bench, while the {\tt TILT}
  attribute can be considered as an tilt alignment error in the
  machine. In fact, a positive $K_3$ with a {\tt TILT=0} is equivalent to a
  positive $K_{3S}$ with positive {\tt TILT=+pi/8}. } 

Example: 
\madxmp{O3: OCTUPOLE, L = 0.3, K3 = 0.543;}

{\bf Note:} Additional attributes can be given to octupoles that

octupole is a cartesian coordinate system. Octupoles are normally
treated as thin lenses, except when tracking by Lie-algebraic methods.   



\section{General Thin Multipole}
\ttindex{multipole}
\label{sec:multipole}

A {\tt MULTIPOLE} is a thin-lens magnet of arbitrary order, including a 
dipole component.

\madbox{
label: MULTIPOLE, \= LRAD = real, TILT = real, \\
                              \> KNL = \{real, \ldots \}, KSL = \{real, \ldots \};
}

\begin{madlist}
    \ttitem{LRAD} A fictitious length, originally only used to
      compute synchrotron radiation effects. \\
      A non-zero {\tt LRAD} in conjunction with
	\hyperref[sec:option]{\tt OPTION, THIN\_FOC=true}
      takes into account the
      weak focussing of bending magnets.
      
    \ttitem{TILT} The roll angle about the longitudinal axis (default: 0
      rad). A positive angle represents a clockwise rotation of the
      multipole element. The roll angle affects all components.
      
    \ttitem{KNL} An array of the integrated normal multipole coefficients, 
      starting from order zero and up to the
      maximum order. The parameters are positional in the array, therefore 
      zeros must be filled in for components that do not exist. \\
      The coefficient of rank $i$ in the array corresponds to the integrated 
      strength $K_i L = B_i . L / (B\rho)$ where the strength is given by 
      equation \ref{eq:kn}. 
      Hence the first argument of the array, the argument for a multipole of 
      order zero, $K_0 L = B_0 . L / (B\rho)$ is equal to the rotation angle of 
      the thin dipole.
      
    \ttitem{KSL} An array of the integrated skew multipole coefficients, 
     starting from order zero and up to the
     maximum order. The parameters are positional in the array, therefore 
     zeros must be filled in for components that do not exist.

\end{madlist}

Both {\tt KNL} and {\tt KSL} may be specified for the same multipole. 

Contrary to \madeight the desired {\tt TILT} angle must be explicitly 
specified, and defaults otherwise to 0 rad. The  roll angle specified with {\tt 
TILT} is global to all multipolar components. 
Hence the {\tt KNL} and {\tt KSL} components can be considered as the 
normal or skew multipole components of the magnet as measured on the 
bench, while the TILT attribute can be considered as an alignment error as 
measured in the machine.


A multipole with no dipole component has no effect on the reference
orbit, i.e. the reference system at its exit is the same as at its
entrance. If it includes a dipole component, it has the same effect on
the reference orbit as a dipole with zero length and deflection angle
equal to the first component of the array {\tt KNL}.  

%In order to know the current maximum order of a given multipole, use the
%command {\tt HELP, MULTIPOLE;} and count.


{\bf Examples:}\\
A thin-lens sextupole:  
\madxmp{ms: MULTIPOLE, KNL=\{0, 0, k2l\};}

A thin-lens skew octupole:  
\madxmp{mso: MULTIPOLE, KSL=\{0, 0, 0, k3sl\};}


A thin-lens multipole with a normal octupole component and a skew decapole
component:
\madxmp{mod: MULTIPOLE, KNL=\{0,0,0,myoct*lrad\}, KSL=\{0,0,0,0,-1.e-5\};
}

\section{Solenoid}
\ttindex{solenoid}
\label{sec:solenoid}

Solenoids can be defined in two forms, a thick and a thin version: 

\madbox{
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\= \kill
label: SOLENOID, L = real,  \>KS = real;           \> ! thick version \\ 
label: SOLENOID, L = 0,     \>KS = real, KSI=real; \> ! thin version 
}

A SOLENOID has three real attributes: 
\begin{madlist}
   \ttitem{L} The length of the solenoid (default: 0 m) 
   \ttitem{KS} The solenoid strength $K_s = B_0 / B\rho$ (default: 0
     rad/m). For positive KS and positive particle charge, the solenoid
     field points in the direction of increasing $s$.  
   \ttitem{KSI} The solenoid integrated strength $K_s L$
     (default: 0 rad).  This additional attribute is needed only when
     using the thin solenoid,  where $L=0$.     
   \ttitem{KNL, KSL}  Take note that one can specify multipole
     coefficients for SOLENOID. They have no effect in \madx proper but are used
     in PTC for solenoid with multipoles.
\end{madlist}

Example: 
\madxmp{
xxxxxxxxxx\=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\= \kill
SOLO:     \> SOLENOID, L = 2., \> KS = 0.001; \\
THINSOLO: \> SOLENOID, L = 0,  \> KS = 0.001, KSI = 0.002;

\label{sec:nllens}

\madbox{
label: NLLENS, KNLL = real, CNLL = real;
}

The NLLENS element represents a thin nonlinear lens with the potential
of 'Elliptic' type as specified in \cite{danilov2010}. The lens is used
to create fully integrable 2D nonlinear accelerator lattice with very
large nonlinear tune spread/shift. The NLLENS element is recognized by
the thin tracking module. The quadrupole term of the potential is
included in the TRANSPORT map and, consequently, effects the calculation
of tunes and Twiss functions.   

\begin{madlist}
   \ttitem{KNLL} The integrated strength of lens (m). The strength is
     parametrized so that the quadrupole term of the multipole
     expansion is k1=2*KNLL/CNLL\textasciicircum2.      
   \ttitem{CNLL} The dimensional parameter of lens (m). The singularities
     of the potential are located at X=-CNLL,+CNLL and Y=0.  
\end{madlist}

The scalar potential function of the element is given by
\begin{equation}
U(x,y)=\frac{k}{c}\frac{\xi\sqrt{\xi^2-1} \, \text{acosh}\xi +  
  \eta\sqrt{1-\eta^2}(\text{acos}\eta-\pi/2)}{\xi^2-\eta^2}
\end{equation}
\\ where \textit{k} = KNLL, \textit{c} = CNLL and 
\begin{equation}
\xi = \frac{\sqrt{(x+c)^2+y^2}+\sqrt{(x-c)^2+y^2}}{2c}, 
\quad \eta = \frac{\sqrt{(x+c)^2+y^2}-\sqrt{(x-c)^2+y^2}}{2c},
\end{equation}

Figure below shows the contour plot of the scalar potential: \\
\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}    
    %\includegraphics[width=220px]{png/nllens_potential-2D.png}
    \includegraphics[width=220px]{jpg/nllens_potential-2D.jpg}
    \caption{Contour plot of the scalar potential}
    \label{fig:nllens_potential}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The multipole expansion of the scalar potential is \\
\begin{equation}
U(x,y)=k\cdot Re\left\{ \left(\dfrac{x + i y}{c}\right)^2 + 
\frac{2}{3}\left(\dfrac{x + i y}{c}\right)^4 +
\frac{8}{15}\left(\dfrac{x + i y}{c}\right)^6 + 
\frac{16}{35}\left(\dfrac{x + i y}{c}\right)^8 + \cdots \right\}
\end{equation}
\\ 
Note that this expansion is only valid inside the \textit{r=c} circle on
the x,y plane.    

In order to create integrable optics, one needs to shape the potential
along z axis according to the beta-function. Below is an example
nonlinear section representing the necessary nonlinear field with 20
thin lenses:  
\begin{verbatim}
    mu0 = 0.3;  ! phase advance over straight section
    l0 = 2.0;   ! length of the straight section
    nn = 20;    ! number of nonlinear elements
    tn = 0.45;  ! strength of nonlinear lens
    cn = 0.01;  ! dimentional parameter of nonlinear lens

    musect = mu0 + 0.5;
    f0 = l0/4.0*(1.0+1.0/tan(pi*mu0)^2);
    betae = l0/sqrt(1.0-(1.0-l0/2.0/f0)^2);
    alfae = l0/2.0/f0/sqrt(1.0-(1.0-l0/2.0/f0)^2);
    betas = l0*(1-l0/4.0/f0)/sqrt(1.0-(1.0-l0/2.0/f0)^2);
    value, f0, betae, alfae, betas;

    ncreate(ii,kk,cc): macro = {n.ii: nllens, knll=kk, cnll=cc;};

    i=0;
    while(i <  nn)
      {
        i = i+1;
        sn = l0/nn*(i-0.5);
        bn = l0*(1-sn*(l0-sn)/l0/f0)/sqrt(1.0-(1.0-l0/2.0/f0)^2);
        knn = l0*tn*cn^2/nn/bn;
        cnn = cn*sqrt(bn);
        exec, ncreate($i,knn,cnn);
        value, i, bn, cnn, knn;
      };

\section{Closed Orbit Correctors}
\ttindex{kicker}\index{orbit corrector}
\label{sec:closed_orbit_cor}\label{sec:kicker}

Three types of closed orbit correctors are available: 
\begin{madlist}
   \ttitem{HKICKER} a corrector for the horizontal plane, 
   \ttitem{VKICKER} a corrector for the vertical plane, 
   \ttitem{KICKER} a corrector for both planes. 
\end{madlist}

\madbox{
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\= \kill
label: HKICKER, \>L = real, KICK = real, \>TILT = real; \\
label: VKICKER, \>L = real, KICK = real, \>TILT = real; \\
label: KICKER,  \>L = real, HKICK = real, \>VKICK = real, TILT = real;
}

{\bf The type {\tt KICKER} should not be used when an orbit corrector
  kicks only in one plane.}

The attributes have the following meaning: 
\begin{madlist}
   \ttitem{L} The length of the closed orbit corrector (default: 0 m). 
   \ttitem{KICK} The momentum change $\delta PX = \delta p_x/p_0$ or 
     $\delta PY = \delta p_y / p_0$ for respectively horizontal or vertical
     correctors. (default: 0).  
   \ttitem{HKICK} The horizontal momentum change 
     $\delta PX = \delta p_x/p_0$ for a corrector acting in both planes
     (default: 0).  
   \ttitem{VKICK} The vertical momentum change 
     $\delta PY = \delta p_y/p_0$  for a corrector acting in both planes
     (default: 0).  
   \ttitem{TILT} The roll angle about the longitudinal axis (default: 0
     rad). A positive angle represents a clockwise rotation of the
     kicker.  
\end{madlist}

A positive kick increases $p_x$ or $p_y$ respectively. This
means that a positive horizontal kick bends to the left,  i.e. to
positive $x$ which is opposite of what is true for bends.    

The deviation angle $\theta$ of the particle trajectory is related to
the momentum change through  $\sin \theta = \delta P = \delta p / p_0$.

It should be noted that the kick values assigned to an orbit corrector
like above are not overwritten by an orbit correction using the CORRECT
command. Instead the kicks computed by an orbit correction and the
assigned values are added when the correctors are used.  

 Examples: 
\madxmp{
xxxxxxx\=xxxxxxxxxx\=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\= \kill
HK1:   \>HKICKER, \>KICK = 0.001;  \\
VK3:   \>VKICKER, \>KICK = 0.0005; \\
VK4:   \>VKICKER, \>KICK := AVK4; \\
KHV1:  \>KICKER,  \>HKICK = 0.001,   \>VKICK = 0.0005; \\
KHV2:  \>KICKER,  \>HKICK := AKHV2H, \>VKICK := AKHV2V;
}

The assignment in the form of a deferred expression has the advantage
that the values can be assigned and/or modified at any time (and
matched!).   

The \href{local_system.html#straight}{straight reference system} for an
orbit corrector is a Cartesian coordinate s ystem.  



Please note that there is a new feature introduced by Stefan Sorge from
GSI. Here his decription:

The elements KICKER, HKICKER, and VKICKER can also be used as  an
exciter providing a sinusoidal momentum kick. The usage in this case is   

\madxmp{
xykick: KICKER,  \= SINKICK=integer, SINPEAK=real, SINTUNE=real, SINPHASE=real;  \\
xkick : HKICKER, \> SINKICK=integer, SINPEAK=real, SINTUNE=real, SINPHASE=real;  \\
ykick : VKICKER, \> SINKICK=integer, SINPEAK=real, SINTUNE=real, SINPHASE=real;  
}
where a sinusoidal momentum kick dpz as a function of the  revolution
number n given by\\   
dpz(n)=SINPEAK * sin(2*PI*SINTUNE*n + SINPHASE), pz=px,py \\ 
is provided. 

The KICKER element generates synchronous kicks in both horizontal and
vertical planes. HKICKER generates only a horizontal kick, and VKICKER
generates only a vertical kick.   

The variables are 

\begin{madlist}
   \ttitem{SINKICK} must be set to 1 to switch on the sinusoidal
     signal, default: 0.  
   \ttitem{SINPEAK} amplitude of the bending angle (rad); default: 0
     rad.   
   \ttitem{SINTUNE} frequency of the signal times the revolution
     frequency.  Hence, the phase per revolution is 2*PI*SINTUNE;
     default: 0.   
   \ttitem{SINPHASE} initial phase; default: 0 rad.  
\end{madlist}

The momentum kick of a kicker has only a single frequency. An element
having a finite bandwidth can approximately created by defining  thin
kickers with all amplitudes SINPEAK, frequencies SINTUNE, and  initial
phases SINPHASE desired and putting them at the same position s in  the
accelerator.

\section{Transverse Kicker}
\ttindex{tkicker}
\label{sec:tkicker}

The type TKICKER should be used to create horizontal, vertical or
combined transverse kickers physically equivalent to elements of type
KICKER, but \textbf{not used} by the closed orbit correction module (see
\href{../cororbit/co_correct.html}{CORRECT} command).   

Examples of elements that may use the type TKICKER: 
\begin{itemize}
   \item Fast kickers for injection, dump \& tune
   \item Magnetic septa towards beam dump
   \item Dampers of transverse beam oscillations
   \item Undulator \& Wiggler magnets
\end{itemize}

For further information on element type TKICKER and its attributes, look
at the documentation of the orbit corrector type
\href{kickers.html#kick}{KICKER}.   


\section{RF Cavity}
\ttindex{RFcavity}
\label{sec:rf_cavity}

\madbox{
label: RFCAVITY, \= L = real, VOLT = real, LAG = real, \\
                 \> HARMON = integer, FREQ = real, \\

}

%  HARMON=integer, BETRF=real,PG=real,
%                  FREQ=real,SHUNT=real,TFILL=real; 


An {\tt RFCAVITY} has eight real attributes and one integer attribute: 
\begin{madlist}
   \ttitem{L} The length of the cavity (DEFAULT: 0 m) 
   \ttitem{VOLT} The peak RF voltage (DEFAULT: 0 MV). The effect of the cavity is \\
     delta(\textit{E}) = VOLT * sin(2 pi * (LAG - HARMON * \textit{f$_0$ t})). 
   \ttitem{LAG} The phase lag [2pi] (DEFAULT: 0). 
   \ttitem{FREQ} The frequency [MHz] (no DEFAULT). Note that if the RF
     frequency is not given, it is computed from the harmonic number and
     the revolution frequency \textit{f$_0$} as before. However, for
     accelerating structures this makes no sense, and the frequency is
     mandatory.  
   \ttitem{HARMON} The harmonic number \textit{h} (no DEFAULT). Only if
     the frequency is not given.  
\end{madlist}

\textit{ Please take note, that the following \madeight attributes:
  BETRF, PG, SHUNT and TFILL are currently not implemented in \madx!}    
%  \item BETRF: RF coupling factor (DEFAULT: 0).
%  \item PG: The RF power per cavity (DEFAULT: 0 MW).
%  \item SHUNT: The relative shunt impedance (DEFAULT: 0 MOhm/m).
%  \item TFILL: The filling time of the cavity $T_{fill}$ (DEFAULT: 0 microseconds). 

\textit{ Note as well that twiss is 4D only. As a consequence
  the TWISS parameters in the plane of non-zero dispersion may not
  close as expected. Therefore, it is best to perform TWISS in 4D
  only, i.e. with cavities switched off. If 6D is needed one has to
  use the \href{../ptc_twiss/ptc_twiss.html}{ptc\_twiss} command. } 

The RFCAVITY can also have attributes that will only become active in PTC: 
\begin{madlist}
   \ttitem{N\_BESSEL} (DEFAULT: 0): \\
     Transverse focussing effects are typically ignored in the cavity in
     \madx or even PTC. This effect is being calculated to order n\_bessel,
     with n\_bessel=0 disregarding this effect and with a correct treatment
     when n\_bessel goes to infinty.
   \ttitem{NO\_CAVITY\_TOTALPATH} (DEFAULT: no\_cavity\_totalpath=false): \\
     flag to select whether the transit time factor in the cavity is to be
     considered (no\_cavity\_totalpath = false) or if the particle is
     kept on the crest of RF voltage (no\_cavity\_totalpath = true).  
\end{madlist}

A cavity requires the particle energy (\href{beam.html#energy}{ENERGY})
and the particle charge (\href{beam.html#charge}{CHARGE}) to be set by a
\href{beam.html}{BEAM} command before any calculations are performed.  

 Example: 
\madxmp{
BEAM, PARTICLE = ELECTRON, ENERGY = 50.0; \\
CAVITY: RFCAVITY, L = 10.0, VOLT = 150.0, LAG = 0.0, HARMON = 31320;
}

The \href{local_system.html#straight}{straight reference system} for a
cavity is a cartesian coordinate system.  


\section{Thin Radio-Frequency Multipole}
\ttindex{rfmultipole}
\label{sec:rfmultipole}

\madbox{
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\= \kill
label: RFMULTIPOLE, \> VOLT = real, LAG = real, \\
       \> HARMON = integer, FREQ = real, \\
       \> LRAD = real, TILT = real, \\

       \> PSL := \{p0s,  p1s,  p2s,  \ldots \};
}

A {\tt RFMULTIPOLE} is a thin-lens element which exhibits the properties
of an RF-cavity and of a magnet of arbitrary order oscillating the
a certain frequency:        

The effect of the cavity is delta(E) = VOLT * sin(2 pi * (LAG - HARMON *
f0 t)). 
 
\begin{madlist}
%   \ttitem{L} The length of the rfmultipole (DEFAULT: 0 m) 
   \ttitem{VOLT} The peak RF voltage (DEFAULT: 0 MV).  
   \ttitem{LAG} The phase lag [2pi] (DEFAULT: 0) 
   \ttitem{FREQ} The frequency [MHz] (no DEFAULT). \\ 
     Note that if the RF
     frequency is not given, it is computed from the harmonic
     number and the revolution frequency f0 as before. However, for
     accelerating structures this makes no sense, and the frequency
     is mandatory.  
   \ttitem{HARMON} The harmonic number h (no DEFAULT). Only if the
     frequency is not given. 
   \ttitem{LRAD} A fictitious length, which was originally just used to
     compute synchrotron radiation effects. A non-zero LRAD in
     conjunction with the OPTION thin\_foc set to a true logical value
     takes into account of the weak focussing of bending magnets.  
   \ttitem{TILT} The roll angle about the longitudinal axis (default: 0
     rad). A positive angle represents a clockwise rotation of the
     multipole element.            

     \textbf{Please note that contrary to \madeight one has to specify the
       desired TILT angle, otherwise it is taken as 0 rad. We
       believe that the \madeight concept of having individual TILT
       values for each component and on top with default values
       led to considerable confusion and allowed for excessive
       and unphysical freedom. Instead, in \madx the KNL/KSL
       components can be considered as the normal or skew
       multipole components of the magnet on the bench, while the
       TILT attribute can be considered as an tilt alignment
       error in the machine.} 

   \ttitem{KNL} The normal rfmultipole coefficients from order zero to
     the maximum; the parameters are positional, therefore zeros
     must be filled in for components that do not exist. Example of
     a thin-lens sextupole: ms:rfmultipole, knl:=\{0, 0, k2l\}; 
   \ttitem{KSL} The skew rfmultipole coefficients from order zero to
     the maximum; the parameters are positional, therefore zeros
     must be filled in for components that do not exist. Example of
     a thin-lens skew octupole:

   \ttitem{PNL} The phase for each normal rfmultipole coefficients from
     order zero to the maximum; the parameters are positional,
     therefore zeros must be filled in for components that do not
     exist.  
   \ttitem{PSL} The phase for each skew rfmultipole coefficients from
     order zero to the maximum; the parameters are positional,
     therefore zeros must be filled in for components that do not
     exist.  
\end{madlist}


{\bf Example:}
\madxmp{MS: RFMULTIPOLE, KSL := \{0, 0, 0, k3sl\};}

Both {\tt KNL} and {\tt KSL} may be specified for the same multipole.  

A {\tt RFMULTIPOLE} requires the particle energy (ENERGY) and the
particle charge (CHARGE) to be set by a \hyperref[sec:beam]{\tt BEAM}
command before any calculations are performed. 

Notice that, contrary to the regular multipole where the dipole
component has no effect on the reference orbit, an RF-Multipole that
includes a dipole component bends also the reference orbit.

\ttindex{elseparator}
\label{sec:separator}

\madbox{
label: ELSEPARATOR, L = real, EX = real, EY = real, TILT = real;
}

An ELSEPARATOR has four real attributes: 
\begin{madlist}
   \ttitem{L} The length of the separator (default: 0 m). 
   \ttitem{EX} The horizontal electric field strength (default: 0 MV/m). 
     A positive field increases \textit{p$_x$} for positive particles.  
   \ttitem{EY} The vertical electric field strength (default: 0 MV/m). 
     A positive field increases \textit{p$_y$} for positive particles.  
   \ttitem{TILT} The roll angle about the longitudinal axis (default: 0
     rad). A positive angle represents a clockwise of the electrostatic
     separator.  
\end{madlist}

A separator requires the particle energy
(\href{beam.html#energy}{ENERGY}) and the particle charge
(\href{beam.html#charge}{CHARGE}) to be set by a \href{beam.html}{BEAM}
command before any calculations are performed.

\section{Beam Position Monitors}
\label{sec:monitor}

A beam monitor has no specific effect on the beam and behaves like a
drift space. 
In addition it serves to record the beam position for closed orbit
correction.

Three different types of beam position monitors are recognised:  

\begin{madlist}
   \item{\href{hmon}{HMONITOR}} Monitor for the horizontal beam position, 
   \item{\href{vmon}{VMONITOR}} Monitor for the vertical beam position, 
   \item{\href{mon}{MONITOR}} Monitor for both horizontal and vertical beam position. 
\end{madlist}

   \ttitem{L} The length of the monitor (default: 0 m). 
     %% If the length is different from zero, the beam position is recorded
     %% in the centre of the monitor.  
\end{madlist}

Examples: 
\madxmp{
MH: HMONITOR, L = 1; \\
MV: VMONITOR;
}

The \href{local_system.html#straight}{straight reference system} for a
monitor is a cartesian coordinate system.

\section{Instruments}
\label{sec:instruments}

An instrument has no specific effect on the beam and behaves like a
drift space. 
Instruments are different from beam position monitors and are not used
for closed orbit correction. 

Two different types of beam position monitors are recognised:  

\begin{itemize}
   \item \href{inst}{INSTRUMENT}. A place holder for any type of beam
     instrumentation. Optically it behaves like a drift space; it
     returns \emph{no beam observation}. It represent a class of
     elements which is completely independent from drifts and monitors.  
   \item \href{plac}{PLACEHOLDER}. A place holder for any type of
     element. Internally it is equivalent to an INSTRUMENT: optically it
     behaves as a drift space, it returns \emph{no beam observation}. It
     represent a class of elements which is completely independent from
     drifts and monitors. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Collimators}
 
The definition of collimators in \madx has been inherited from \madeight
and two types of collimators are defined:  
\begin{itemize}
   \item \href{ecol}{ECOLLIMATOR}. 
   \item \href{rcol}{RCOLLIMATOR}. 
\end{itemize}  
Note that although two types are defined, both behave in exactly the
same way within \madx and the type name does NOT imply elliptic or
rectangular aperture.    

\madbox{
label: ECOLLIMATOR, TYPE = name, L = real, XSIZE = real, YSIZE = real; \\
label: RCOLLIMATOR, TYPE = name, L = real, XSIZE = real, YSIZE = real;
}

Either type has several real attributes: 
\begin{madlist}
   \ttitem{L} The collimator length (default: 0 m). 
   \ttitem{XSIZE} The horizontal half-aperture (default:
     unlimited). \textbf{OBSOLETE : Will be parsed but not used.} 
   \ttitem{YSIZE} The vertical half-aperture (default:
     unlimited). \textbf{OBSOLETE : Will be parsed but not used.} 
\end{madlist}

The actual definition of the aperture type and aperture parameters must
be done in accordance with \href{aperture.html}{Defining aperture in
  \madx}.   

Optically a collimator behaves like a drift space.  However during
tracking the aperture is checked at the entrance of the collimator,
provided that the aperture type is one of the predefined RECTANGLE,
ELLIPSE, RECTELLIPSE or LHCSCREEN types.  In particular an aperture
model defined in an external file will not be used during tracking.  

If the length is not zero, the aperture is also checked at the
exit. \textbf{ TO BE CHECKED } 

Example: 
\madxmp{
COLLIM: ECOLLIMATOR, L = 0.5, APERTYPE = ELLIPSE, APERTURE = {0.01,0.005};
}

The \href{local_system.html#straight}{straight reference system} for a
collimator is a cartesian coordinate system.  

\textbf{NOTE:} When a collimator is displaced transversally in order to
model  an asymmetric collimator, particle losses in tracking are
reported with respect to the \textbf{displaced} reference system, not
with respect to the surrounding beam line.

\section{Beam-beam Interaction}
The BEAMBEAM element may be inserted in a beam line to simulate a
beam-beam interaction point:  
 
\madbox{
label: BEAMBEAM, \= SIGX = real, SIGY = real, \\
                 \> XMA = real, YMA = real, CHARGE = real, \\
                 \> BBSHAPE = int, WIDTH = real, BBDIR = int;
}

The beam-beam interaction is represented by a four-dimensional
interaction with a thin element, i.e. horizontal and vertical non-linear kicks.
The code for this element has been contributed by J.M. Veuillen (1987)
and extended by S. Sorge (2007).  
 
\begin{madlist}
   \ttitem{SIGX}
     The horizontal extent of the opposite beam (default: 1 m).
     Meaning depends on parameter BBSHAPE.
   \ttitem{SIGY}
     The vertical extent of the opposite beam (default: 1 m).
     Meaning depends on parameter BBSHAPE.
   \ttitem{XMA}
     The horizontal displacement of the opposite beam with respect to
     the ideal orbit (default: 0 m).
   \ttitem{YMA}
     The vertical displacement of the opposite beam with respect to
     the ideal orbit (default: 0 m).
   \ttitem{CHARGE}
     The charge of particles in the opposite beam in elementary charges. 
     It is set by default CHARGE=1. So, if you want to describe collisions 
     between beams containing the same particles having a charge different 
     from 1, you have to set CHARGE explicitly in BEAM and 
     in BEAMBEAM. 
   \ttitem{BBSHAPE} The parameter to choose the radial density shape of the 
     opposite beam (default: 1)
     \begin{itemize}
       \item  BBSHAPE=1: Gaussian shape (default), SIGX/SIGY: standard deviation in 
         vertical/horizontal direction.
	\item  BBSHAPE=2: trapezoidal shape (see fig.\ref{fig:beambeam_n_trapez}), 
          SIGX/SIGY: half width of density profile,
          i.e. distance from the centre to half edge region with linear decrease of 
          density in horizontal/vertical direction. Still only circular opposite beam 
          possible, i.e. in the calculations 
          SIGX'=SIGY'=(SIGX+SIGY)/2 is used, if SIGX and SIGY have
          different values 

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=400px]{jpg/beambeam_n_trapez.jpg}
    \caption{Trapezoidal shape of radial density for beam-beam lens.} 
    \label{fig:beambeam_n_trapez}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

        \item  BBSHAPE=3: hollow-parabolic shape (see
          fig.\ref{fig:beambeam_n_hollowparabol},  
          SIGX/SIGY: distance from the centre 
          to the maximum of the parabolic density profile in vertical/horizontal 
          direction. Still only circular opposite beam possible, 
          i.e. in the calculations 
          SIGX'=SIGY'=(SIGX+SIGY)/2 is used, if SIGX and SIGY have different values 

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \flushright
    \includegraphics[width=420px]{jpg/beambeam_n_hollowparabol.jpg}
    \caption{Hollow parabolic shape of radial density for beam-beam lens.} 
    \label{fig:beambeam_n_hollowparabol}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

     \end{itemize}
     
     The restriction to circular opposite beams in the cases BBSHAPE=2,3 
     appears to be sufficient, because such beam profiles are more important 
     for the description of the interaction between the particle beam and 
     an electron beam of an electron cooler, which are usually circular. 
     
   \ttitem{WIDTH} The relative extent of the edge region, absolute value is given by 
     WIDTH*SIGX and WIDTH*SIGY vertical and horizontal direction, respectively. 
     For 
     \begin{itemize}
        \item  BBSHAPE=1, WIDTH is meaningless and will be ignored.
	\item  BBSHAPE=2, WIDTH denotes the full width of the edge region in units of 
          SIGX (or SIGX' and SIGY', respectively, if SIGX and SIGY are not equal), i.e. 
          if WIDTH=0.01 and SIGX=5 mm, the edge  region has a full width of 0.05
          mm. It must be WIDTH \textless   2.0.
	\item  BBSHAPE=3, WIDTH denotes the full width at half maximum of the parabolic 
          density profile in units of SIGX (or SIGX' and SIGY', respectively, if SIGX 
          SIGY are not equal. It must be WIDTH \textless SQRT(2.0).
     \end{itemize} 

   \ttitem{BBDIR} The parameter to choose the direction of motion of the 
     opposite beam relative to the beam considered. It determines 
     the sign of the Lorenz force between the both beams (default: -1): 
     \begin{itemize}
        \item  BBDIR=-1: Beams move in the opposite direction as in a collider. 
          Therefore, the Lorenz force enhances the beam-beam interaction. 
	\item  BBDIR=0: Opposite beam does not move, Lorenz force is neglected 
	\item  BBDIR=1: Beams move in the same direction as in an electron cooler. 
          So, the Lorenz force reduces the beam-beam interaction. 
     \end{itemize}
     Note:  
     \begin{itemize}  
        \item  The particles in the beam considered may have a momentum deviation 
          given by DELTAP defined in the TRACK command. 
	\item  The opposite beam is assumed to have the velocity according to the 
          unperturbed energy o the particles in the beam considered. 
          So, only the direction of motion can be chosen. 
	\item  In the case of motion in the opposite direction (BBDIR=-1), 
          the time of interaction between the beams is given by 
          tau = length/(2*beta*c\_light), where length is the length of a bunch in the 
          opposite beam. In the case of motion in the same direction 
          (BBDIR=1) as in an electron cooler, this time 
          is given by tau = length/(beta*c\_light), where length is the length of 
          the cooler. So, the factor 1/2 is inserted only for BBDIR=-1 to calculate 
          correct results. 
     \end{itemize} 
\end{madlist}


A beam-beam element requires the particle energy
(\href{beam.html#energy}{ENERGY})
and the particle charge
(\href{beam.html#charge}{CHARGE})
as well as the number of particles per bunch 
(\href{beam.html#npart}{NPART})
to be set by a \href{beam.html}{BEAM} command
before any calculations are performed.


Examples of a four-dimensional beam-beam element definition:
 
Collider regime example:
\madxmp{
beam,   particle = positron, npart = 1.e12, energy = 50.0; \\
bb:     beambeam, sigx = 1.e-3, sigy = 5.e-4, charge = 1.;
}


Electron cooler example: 
\madxmp{
gamma0 = 1.032;                          \= ! relativistic factors \\
beta0 = sqrt(1.0-1.0/gamm0/gamma0);      \>  \\
\> \\
i\_e = 0.2;                              \> ! electron current \\
re\_cool = 0.01;                         \> ! electron beam radius \\
l\_cool = 5.0;                           \> ! cooling length \\
\\
nelect = i\_e*l\_cool/beta0/clight/qelect; ! electron number in e-cooler \\
\\
beam, particle = antiproton, gamma = gamma0, npart = nelect;  \\
bb\_ecool: beambeam, sigx = re\_cool, sigy = re\_cool, bbshape = 2, \\
\hskip 4.2cm                     width = 0.01, charge = -1, bbdir = 1;
}

\section{Arbitrary Matrix Element}

\madbox{
label: MATRIX, \= TYPE  \= = name, L = real, \= KICK1 = real,..., KICK6 = real, \\
               \> RM11  \> = real,..., RM66  \> = real, \\
               \> TM111 \> = real,..., TM666 \> = real;
}

The MATRIX permits the definition of an arbitrary transfer matrix. 
It has four real array attributes: 
\begin{madlist}
   \ttitem{L} Length of the element, which may be zero. 
   \ttitem{KICKi} Defines the kick of the element acting on the six phase
     space coordinates.  
   \ttitem{RMik} Defines the linear transfer matrix (6*6) of the element.  
   \ttitem{TMikl} Defines the second-order terms (6*6*6) of the element. 
\end{madlist}

Data values not entered are taken from the identity transformation, kick
and second order terms are zero as default. In the thin-lens tracking
module the length of an arbitrary matrix is accepted, however no second
order are allowed to avoid non symplectic tracking runs. In the latter
case the tracking run will be aborted.


%\section{Coordinate Transformations}
\section{Rotation around the vertical axis}
\label{sec:yrotation}

\madbox{
label: YROTATION, TYPE = name, ANGLE = real;
}

The element {\tt YROTATION} rotates the
\hyperref[subsec:local_straight]{straight reference system} about the
vertical (\texttt{y}) axis. 

YROTATION has no effect on the beam, but it
causes the beam to be referred to the new coordinate system  \\
\textit{x}$_2$=\textit{x}$_1$cos(theta)-\textit{s}$_1$sin(theta), \\
\textit{y}$_2$=\textit{x}$_1$sin(theta)+\textit{s}$_1$cos(theta).\\

It has one real attribute: 
\begin{madlist}
   \ttitem{ANGLE} The rotation angle theta (default: 0 rad). It must be a
     \emph{small} angle, i.e. an angle comparable to the transverse
     angles of the orbit. 
\end{madlist}

A positive angle means that the new reference system is rotated
clockwise about the local \texttt{y}-axis with respect to the old system. 

Example: 
\madxmp{
KINK: YROTATION, ANGLE = 0.0001;
}

\section{Rotation around the longitudinal axis}
\label{sec:srotation}

\madbox{
label: SROTATION, ANGLE = real;
}

The element {\tt SROTATION} rotates the
\hyperref[subsec:local_straight]{straight reference system} about the
longitudinal (\texttt{s}) axis. 

SROTATION has no effect on the beam, but it causes the beam to be
referred to the new coordinate system \\ 
\textit{x}$_2$=\textit{x}$_1$cos(psi)-\textit{y}$_1$sin(psi),\\
\textit{y}$_2$=\textit{x}$_1$sin(psi)+\textit{y}$_1$cos(psi).\\ 

It has one real attribute: 
\begin{madlist}
   \ttitem{ANGLE} The rotation angle psi (default: 0 rad) 
\end{madlist}

A positive angle means that the new reference system is rotated
clockwise about the \texttt{s}-axis with respect to the old system.  

Example: 
\madxmp{
ROLL1: SROTATION, ANGLE =  PI/2.; \\
ROLL2: SROTATION, ANGLE = -PI/2.; \\
HBEND: SBEND, L = 6.0, ANGLE = 0.01; \\
VBEND: LINE = (ROLL1,HBEND,ROLL2); \\
}
The VBEND definition above is a way to represent a bend down in the
vertical plane, it could be defined more simply by  
\madxmp{
VBEND: SBEND, L = 6.0, K0S = 0.01/6;
}
