\chapter{Orbit Correction}  

This chapter describes the commands to correct a closed orbit or a
trajectory. The initial orbit or trajectory to be corrected can be
obtained  from an internal or external TFS table.   

The purpose of this orbit module is to provide some basic tools to
assess the performance of an orbit correction system of a machine in the
design phase.  

Although some interface is available, it cannot and does not provide the
full functionality expected from a dedicated online orbit correction and
steering program.

\section{CORRECT}  
\label{sec:correct}

The CORRECT statement makes a complete closed orbit  or trajectory
correction using the \textbf{computed} values at the monitors  from the
Twiss table.   

The CORRECT command has the following format (some options are valid
only for special algorithms):   

\madbox{
CORRECT, \=ORBIT=orbittable, MODEL=modeltable, TARGET=targettable, \\
         \>SEQUENCE=seqname, \\
         \>FLAG=string, MODE=string, COND=integer,\\
         \>TWISSUM=integer, \\
         \>NCORR=integer, CORRLIM=real, \\
         \>MONERROR=integer, MONON=real, MONSCALE=real, ERROR=real,\\ 
         \>PLANE=string,  RESOUT=integer, \\
         \>CLIST=filename, MLIST=filename, \\
         \>UNITS=real, CORZERO=integer, \\

The command CORRECT is set up with defaults which should allow a
reasonable correction for most cases with a minimum of required options
(see Example 1 below).  

The orbit correction must always be preceded by TWISS commands  which
generate Twiss tables. The most recent Twiss table is assumed to contain
the optical parameters and the distorted orbits. 

The options used in the CORRECT command are: 

\begin{madlist}
   \ttitem{FLAG} can be "ring" or "line", either a circular machine
     or a trajectory is corrected.   
     \\ Default flag is "ring". 

   \ttitem{MODE} defines the method to be used for corrections. 
     \\ Available modes are LSQ, MICADO and SVD.  The first performs a
     least squares minimization using all available correctors. The mode
     SVD uses a Singular Value Decomposition to compute a correction
     using all available correctors. The latter can also be used to
     condition the response matrix for the modes LSQ or MICADO (using
     COND=1). It is highly recommended to precede a LSQ correction by a
     SVD conditioning (set COND=1).  
     \\ The mode MICADO is a "best kick" algorithm. Naive use or using
     it with a large number of correctors (see option NCORR) can give
     unexpected results. To avoid the creation of local bumps, it is
     recommended to precede a MICADO correction by a SVD conditioning
     (set COND=1).  
     \\ Default mode is MICADO.            

   \ttitem{PLANE} If this attribute is x, only the horizontal correction
     is made; if it is y, only the vertical correction is made. (This
     differs from the MAD8 implementation).  
     \\ Default plane is horizontal. 

   \ttitem{COND} When COND is 1, a Singular Value Decomposition is
     performed and  the response matrix CONDitioned to avoid linearly
     dependent correctors. This can be used to avoid creation of
     artificial bumps during a LSQ or MICADO correction (requires some
     computing time).  Please note: this option is not robust since it
     depends on parameters which control the determination of singular
     values and redundant correctors. These can be set with the commands
     SNGVAL and SNGCUT. Both parameters depend on the machine and may
     need adjustment. Default values are adjusted to large machines and
     "reasonable" performance for smaller machines.  
     \\

   \ttitem{NCORR} Only used by the MICADO algorithm. Defines the number of
     correctors to be used, unless set to 0 in which case all available
     correctors are used.  
     \\ Default is 0 (all available correctors). 

   \ttitem{SNGVAL}  Used to set the threshold for finding singular values
     with the COND command. (Hint: smaller number finds fewer singular
     values).  
     \\ {\bf Use with care ! }
     \\ Default is 2.0 

   \ttitem{SNGCUT}  Used to set the threshold for finding redundant
     correctors with the COND command. (Hint: larger number finds fewer
     redundant correctors).  
     \\ {\bf Use with extreme care ! }
     \\ Default is 50.0 

   \ttitem{MONERROR} When MONERROR is 1, the alignment errors on monitors
     assigned  by \href{../error/error_align.html}{EALIGN} MREX and MREY
     are taken into account, otherwise they are ignored.  
     \\ Default is 0. 

   \ttitem{MONSCALE} When MONSCALE is 1, the scaling errors on monitors
     assigned  by \href{../error/error_align.html}{EALIGN} MSCALX and
     MSCALY are taken into account, otherwise they are ignored.  
     \\ Default is 0. 

   \ttitem{MONON} takes a real number between 0.0 and 1.0. It
     determines the number of available monitors. If the command is
     given, each monitor is considered valid with a probability
     MONON. In the average a fraction (1.0 - MONON) of the monitors will
     be disabled for the correction, i.e. they are considered  not
     existing.  This allows to study the effect of missing monitors.  
     \\ Default is 1.0 (100 \%). 

   \ttitem{CORRLIM}  A limit on the maximum corrector strength can be
     given and a WARNING is issued if it is exceeded by one or more
     correctors.  Please note: the strengths computed by the correction
     algorithms are NOT limited, only a warning is printed ! 
     \\ Default is 1.0 mrad. \\

   \ttitem{TWORING} When true, the correction will be done on two rings at
     once. The only correction mode available in this case is
     MICADO. The parameter ORBIT=table is ignored and BEAM1TAB=table and
     BEAM2TAB=table are used instead.  
     \\ Default: false \\

   \ttitem{UNITS} when this parameter is set the value is a multiplier [TO BE COMPLETED] 
     \\ Default unknown \\

   \ttitem{ERROR} specifies the maximum RMS value of the orbit to
     be reached by the correction algorithm. The value is specified in
     meters, e.g. ERROR=1.e-3 for a 1mm RMS target value. \\ Default is
     1.e-5 m.\\

\end{madlist}

Normally the last active table provides the orbit to be
corrected and the model for the correction. This can be overwritten
by the appropriate options. Optionally, these tables can be given
names like in:  TWISS, TABLE=name; (see documentation on TWISS
command). To use these named tables, one of the following optional
parameters must be  used:  

\begin{madlist}
   \ttitem{ORBIT} When this parameter is given, the orbit to be corrected
     is taken from a named table. The default is the last (named or
     unnamed) Twiss table.  

   \ttitem{MODEL} When this parameter is given, the model for the
     correction is taken from a named Twiss table. The default is the
     last (named or unnamed) Twiss table.  

   \ttitem{TARGET} When this parameter is given, the correction is made to
     a named target orbit, pre-computed with a TWISS command. Default is
     correction to the zero orbit.  

   \ttitem{EXTERN} (default: false): When false, the ORBIT and TARGET table
     are assumed to be computed by MAD with a previous twiss
     command. When set to true, that option allows to use twiss tables
     imported from an external file (with the readmytable command), for
     example to use measured BPM data. In that case, the imported twiss
     table is allowed to contain coordinate data only at the location of
     the monitors.  
\end{madlist}

Example of use of CORRECT to reproduce a measured orbit: 
\begin{verbatim}
! To have a refererence optical model
twiss, table=twiss_ref;

! The bpm.tsv is a reduced Twiss file containing only lines for the BPMs
readmytable, file="bpm.tsv", table="twiss_bpm";

! correct orbit using external measurements
correct, flag=ring, mode=micado, ncorr=5, cond=1 ,plane=x, extern,
         model=twiss_ref, orbit=twiss_ref, target=twiss_bpm, 
         error=1.0e-21;
\end{verbatim}


Two attributes affect the printing of tables and results: 
\begin{madlist}
   \ttitem{CLIST} =\textbf{file}: Corrector settings (in units of rad)
     before and after correction printed to \textbf{file} 

   \ttitem{MLIST} =\textbf{file}: Monitor readings (in units of m) before
     and after correction printed to \textbf{file} 

   \ttitem{RESOUT} This command outputs the results for all monitors and
     all correctors in a computer readable format if its integer
     argument is larger than 0. The argument is added to the
     output. Useful to analyze runs with loops to produce large
     statistics. \\
     \textbf{ATTENTION: May produce gigantic outputs for large
       machines.} 
     \\

   \ttitem{TWISSUM}  If the argument of twissum is larger than 0, it
     prints maximum orbit and r.m.s. for both planes taken from the
     Twiss summary table in computer readable form. Allows to analyze
     orbits etc. at elements that are not monitors or correctors. The
     argument is added to the output.  Only for output: no correction is
     made, all other commands are ignored.  
\end{madlist}

Obsolete commands or options:
\begin{verbatim}
ITERATE, ITERMAX             /* Done with loop feature in MAD commands */
THREADER, THRTOL, WRORBIT    /* Not part of orbit correction module */
M1LIST, M2LIST               /* Replaced by MLIST */
C1LIST, C2LIST               /* Replaced by CLIST */
GETORBIT, PUTORBIT           /* Replaced by generic TFS access */
GETKICK, PUTKICK             /* Replaced by generic TFS access */
\end{verbatim}

{\bf EXAMPLES:}\\ 
for complete MAD input files see section on examples:

Example 1: correct orbit in horizontal plane, taken from most recent
Twiss table, using default algorithm (MICADO)
\begin{verbatim}
 CORRECT, PLANE = x; 
\end{verbatim}

Example 2: no correction, only output of Twiss summary 
\begin{verbatim}
CORRECT, TWISSUM = 1; 
\end{verbatim}

Example 3: correct orbit in horizontal plane, corrector and monitor
output on table 
\begin{verbatim}
CORRECT, PLANE = x, MODE = lsq, CLIST = corr.out, MLIST = mon.out;   
\end{verbatim}

Example 4: correct orbit in horizontal plane, use alignment and scaling
errors, 15\% of orbit correctors faulty
\begin{verbatim}
CORRECT, PLANE = x, MONERROR = 1, MONSCALE = 1, MONON = 0.85; 
\end{verbatim}

Example 5: correct orbit in horizontal plane for a two-beam machine,
using MICADO with no SVD conditioning, zeroing correctors before the
correction. 
\begin{verbatim}
CORRECT, FLAG=ring,
         TWORING, BEAM1TAB=twb1, BEAM2TAB=twb2,
         MODE=micado, COND=0, NCORR=4, ERROR=1E-6, PLANE=x,
         MLIST='mx12.tab', CLIST='cx12.tab', RESOUT=1, CORZERO=1;
\end{verbatim}




%\input{cororbit/co_activate}
\section{USEMONITOR, USEKICK}
\label{sec:activate}
To provide more flexibility with orbit correction two commands are
provided:  

\madbox{
USEMONITOR, \=STATUS=flag, SEQUENCE=sequence, RANGE=range, \\
            \>CLASS=class, PATTERN=regex; \\
\\
USEKICK,    \>STATUS=flag, SEQUENCE=sequence, RANGE=range, \\
            \>CLASS=class, PATTERN=regex;
}

The command \texttt{USEMONITOR} activates or deactivates a
selection of beam position monitor. 
This command affects elements of types \texttt{MONITOR, HMONITOR},
and \texttt{VMONITOR}.    

The command  \texttt{USEKICK} activates or deactivates a selection
of orbit correctors. This command
affects elements of types \texttt{KICKER, HKICKER} and \texttt{VKICKER}. 


Both commands have the same attributes: 
\begin{madlist}
   \ttitem{STATUS} If this flag is true (on), the selected elements
     are activated. Active orbit monitor readings will be
     considered, and active correctors can change their strengths
     in subsequent correction commands. Inactive elements will be
     ignored subsequently.  
   \ttitem{SEQUENCE} The sequence can be specified, otherwise the
     currect sequence is used for this operation.  
   \ttitemn{RANGE, CLASS, PATTERN}: The usual selection commands are
     used to identify the elements for this operation.  
\end{madlist} 

Example:
\begin{verbatim}
USE,...                                ! set working beam line 
...                                    ! define imperfections 
USEKICK, STATUS = OFF, RANGE = ...;    ! deactivate selected correctors 
USEMONITOR, STATUS = OFF, RANGE = ...; ! deactivate selected monitors   
CORRECT, NCORR = 32;                   ! uses different set of correctors
USEKICK, STATUS = OFF, RANGE = ...;    ! deactivate different set of correctors 
CORRECT, NCORR = 32;                   ! uses different set of correctors
\end{verbatim}

\madbox{
COPTION, SEED=integer, PRINT=integer;      
}

In the orbit program monitors can be randomly disabled and the correct
option command specifies different seeds for random values:  

\begin{madlist}
   \ttitem{SEED} Selects a particular sequence of random values. 
     \\ A SEED value is an integer in the range [0...999999999] (default: 123456789). 
     \\ SEED alone continues with the current sequence 
     \\ See also: \href{../Introduction/expression.html#random}{Random values}. 
     \\ SEED may be an expression. 
   \ttitem{PRINT} This flag can take integer values and controls the printout. 
     \\ In general: the higher its value the more printout is produced.  
     \\ For PRINT=0 no output is produced. 
     \\ The default value is 1 (Correction summary is given). 
\end{madlist}

{\bf Example:}
\madxmp{
COPTION, SEED=987456321, PRINT=2;
}

Note that the random generator for MAD is taken from \cite{knuth1981}.
