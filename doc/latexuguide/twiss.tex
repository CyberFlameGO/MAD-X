\chapter{Twiss Module}
\label{chap:twiss}

The \texttt{TWISS} command calculates the
\href{../Introduction/tables.html#linear}{linear lattice
  functions}\cite{Courant_Snyder1958}, and optionally the
\href{../Introduction/tables.html#chrom}{chromatic functions}. 
The coupled functions are calculated in the sense of
Edwards and Teng\cite{edwards1973}. 
For the uncoupled cases they reduce to the C and S functions. 

\madbox{
TWISS, \=SEQUENCE=seqname, LINE=linename, RANGE=range,  \\
       \>DELTAP=real\{,real\}||initial:final:step,\\
       \>CHROM=logical,\\
       \>CENTRE=logical, TOLERANCE=real, \\
       \>FILE=filename, \\
       \>TABLE=tablename, NOTABLE=logical,\\
       \>RMATRIX=logical, 
       \>SECTORMAP=logical, SECTORTABLE=tablename, SECTORFILE=filename,\\
       \>KEEPORBIT=name, USEORBIT=name,\\
       \>COUPLE=logical,\\
       \>RIPKEN=logical;
}

The  attributes of the \texttt{TWISS} command are: 
\begin{madlist}
  \ttitem{SEQUENCE}  =seqname is the name of a valid sequence for
  which the calculation of optical functions should be performed. \\ 
  \texttt{SEQUENCE} and \texttt{LINE} are mutually exclusive.\\
  (Default: sequence or beam line defined in the latest USE command)

  \ttitem{LINE} =linename is the name of a valid beamline for which
  the calculation of optical functions should be performed. \\
  \texttt{SEQUENCE} and \texttt{LINE} are mutually exclusive.\\
  (Default: sequence or beam line defined in the latest USE command)
  
  \ttitem{RANGE}=range (Default: \texttt{\#S/\#E})\\
  The \texttt{TWISS} calculation is restricted to the specified range.
  See \href{../Introduction/ranges.html#range}{RANGE}.  

  \ttitem{DELTAP}={\tt real\{,real\}} or {\tt initial:final:step}
  (Default: 0.0)\\ 
  The relative energy error \texttt{DELTAP} may be entered in one of the
  two forms above. \\ 
  The first form lists several numbers, which may be general expressions,
  separated by commas. The second form specifies an initial value, a final
  value, and a step, which must be constant expressions, separated by
  colons. \\
  For example, \texttt{DELTAP=0.001} defines a single value, 
  \texttt{DELTAP=0.001,0.005} define two values and 
  \texttt{DELTAP=0.001:0.007:0.002} define four values. 


  \ttitem{CHROM} A logical flag. If set, \madx also computes the
  \href{../Introduction/tables.html#chrom}{chromatic
    functions} as well as the radiation synchrotron integrals. \\
  \textit{Please note that this option is needed for a proper
    calculation of the chromaticities in the presence of coupling!}\\
  \textit{Please note that this option also changes the way that the
    chromaticities are calculated: The chromaticities are normally
    calculated from the analysis of the first and second order
    matrices. With \texttt{CHROM}, the chromaticities are recalculated by
    explicitely calculating the tunes for the case of the specified momentum
    deviation \texttt{DELTAP} and for the case of a momentum deviation equal
    to \texttt{DELTAP}+1.e-6. The tune differences divided by 1.e-6 yield the
    chromaticities.}

  \ttitem{CENTRE} = logical (Default: false) \\
  This flag enforces the calculation of the
  \href{../Introduction/tables.html#linear}{linear lattice
    functions} at the center of the element instead of the end
  of the element. The values in the tables and in the output files are
  affected by this flag. \\ 
  \textit{ Since the lattice functions are calculated inside the element
    the closed orbit coordinates in the output also include the misalignment
    of the element.}  

  \ttitem{TOLERANCE} (Default: 1.e-6) \\
  The maximum closed orbit error, for all six orbit components, 
  that can be tolerated during the closed orbit search. 
  The value given in the \texttt{TWISS} command is only valid for the current calculation; 
  the \href{../control/general.html#coguess}{\texttt{COGUESS}} command allows to 
  change the default value for all subsequent closed orbit search calculations. 

  \ttitem{FILE} (Default: ``twiss'') \\
  causes \madx to writes a  \href{../Introduction/select.html#tfs}{TFS Twiss table} 
  to the file specified. \\
  The columns of the table can be selected using the \texttt{SELECT}
  command with the \texttt{FLAG=twiss} attribute. 

  \ttitem{TABLE} (overrides SAVE): \madx creates a full
  \href{../Introduction/tables.html#linear}{Twiss table} in
  memory and gives it the name \texttt{TWISS}, unless \texttt{TABLE=tablename}
  appears on the command, then it is called
  \href{../Introduction/label.html}{"tablename"}. This table
  includes linear lattice functions as well as the chromatic
  functions for all positions. An important new feature of \madx
  is the possibility to access entries of tables and in
  particular the twiss table (see
  \href{../Introduction/expression.html#table}{table access}).\\
  If the \texttt{TABLE} option is given the selection of column names via the
  \texttt{SELECT} command is ignored. Hence if both \texttt{TABLE} and
  \texttt{FILE} options are given, the table written to file is the full
  twiss table, containing all elements as rows and all known twiss 
  parameters as columns. 

  \ttitem{NOTABLE} This flag prevents the creation of the internal twiss
  table. Consequently no output file can be created either.  \\ 
  (Default: false)
  

  \ttitem{RMATRIX} If this flag is used the the one-turn map at the
  location of every element is calculated and prepared for
  storage in the twiss table. Using the
  \href{../Introduction/select.html}{\texttt{SELECT}} command and using
  the column \texttt{RE, RE11 \ldots RE16 \ldots RE61 \ldots RE66} these
  components will be added to the twiss table, i.e. with \texttt{"COLUMN, RE"} and
  \texttt{"COLUMN, REij"} one gets all or the component "ij" respectively.    

  \ttitem{SECTORMAP} This flag initiates the calculation of a sector
  map as described at:
  \href{../Introduction/sectormap.html}{SECTORMAP}.    
  
  \ttitem{SECTORTABLE} the name of the table containing the SECTORMAP
  values. The elements (lines) and parameters (columns) 
  of the table can be tailored using the SELECT command as specified in 
  \hyperref[sec:sectormap]{\tt SECTORMAP} \\
  (Default: sectortable)

  \ttitem{SECTORFILE} the name of the file to which the SECTORMAP will
  be written. 
  The format of the output can be adjusted as specified in 
  \hyperref[sec:sectormap]{\tt SECTORMAP} \\
  (Default: "sectormap")
  %% Used to write SECTORMAPs to the file
  %% SECTORFILE="filename", if missing the output of SECTORMAP
  %% will go to the file "sectormap" with the format as found in
  %% \href{../Introduction/sectormap.html}{SECTORMAP}.    
  
  \ttitem{KEEPORBIT} The keeporbit attribute (with an optional name,
  keeporbit="name") stores the orbit under this name at the
  start, and at all monitors.    

  \ttitem{USEORBIT} The useorbit attribute (with an optional name,
  useorbit="name") uses the start value provided for the closed
  orbit search; the values at the monitors are used by the
  threader.    

  \ttitem{COUPLE} (obsolete) This \madeight option can no
  longer be set since TWISS in \madx is always calculated in
  coupled mode. \madx computes the coupled functions in the
  sense of
  \href{../Introduction/bibliography.html#edwards}{[Edwards and
      Teng]}. For the uncoupled cases they reduce to the C and S
  functions.    
  
  \textit{ Twiss calculation is 4D only!} : The Twiss
  command will calculate an approximate 6D closed orbit when the
  accelerator structure includes an active
  \href{../Introduction/cavity.html}{cavity}. However, the
  calcuation of the Twiss parameters are 4D only. This may
  result in apparently non-closure of the beta values in the
  plane with non-zero dispersion. The full 6D Twiss parameters
  can be calculated with the
  \href{../ptc_twiss/ptc_twiss.html}{ptc\_twiss} command.    

  \ttitem{RIPKEN} This flag will calculate the Ripken-Mais TWISS
  parameters (beta11, beta12, beta21, beta22, alfa11, alfa12,
  alfa21, alfa22, gama11, gamma12, gamm21 and gamm22) using
  betx, bety, alfx, alfy, gamax, gamay, R11, R12, R21 and R22 as
  input.  

\end{madlist}

The tables are suitable for \texttt{PLOT}.   

After a successful \texttt{TWISS} run \madx creates a 
table of summary parameters named "SUMM" which includes tunes,
chromaticities, etc. versus the selected values of \texttt{DELTAP}.
Please note that the \texttt{CHROM} attribute is needed
for a proper calculation of the chromaticities in the presence of
coupling!. 

Notice also that in \madx DELTAP is converted to PT, which is used as
longitudinal variable. 
Dispersive and chromatic functions are hence derivatives with
respects to PT. 
(see \href{../Introduction/tables.html#summ}{table}). 

These summary parameters can later be accessed via the table access
functions\ref{chap:tables} using the "SUMM" table.  

\section{Twiss Parameters for a Period}
\label{sec:twissperiod}

The simplest form of the TWISS command is
\madbox{
TWISS;
}
which calculates the periodic solution for the last beamline or sequence
declared in a \texttt{USE} statement, and with zero DELTAP.
Chromatic functions are not calculated. 
Standard tables ("TWISS" and "SUMM") are created in memory but no file
is written to disk. 

The slightly more elaborate version 
\madbox{
TWISS, DELTAP=real\{,real\}, CHROM, TABLE=tablename;
}
computes the periodic solution, including chromatic functions, for the last beam
line or sequence declared in a \texttt{USE} statement, for all values of
DELTAP entered (or for \texttt{DELTAP=0}, if none is entered). 
The tables "tablename" and "SUMM" are created in memory and no file is
written to disk. 

{\bf Example:} 
\madxmp{
USE, period=OCT; \\
TWISS, DELTAP=0.001, CHROM;
}
computes the periodic solution for the linear lattice and
chromatic functions for the beam line OCT and for DELTAP=0.001. 

%% Apart from saving computing time, it is equivalent to the command
%% sequence  
%% \begin{verbatim}
%% RING: LINE=(4*(OCT,-OCT));
%%       USE,period=RING;
%%       TWISS,DELTAP=0.001,CHROM;
%% \end{verbatim}

\section{Initial Values from a Periodic Line}
\label{sec:twissinitial}

It is possible to track the lattice functions starting with the periodic
solution for another beam line. If this is desired the TWISS command
takes the form  
\madbox{
TWISS, \=DELTAP=real\{,real\}, LINE=beamline, \\
       \>MUX=real, MUY=real, \\
       \>TABLE=tablename;
}
No other attributes should appear in the command. For each value of
DELTAP, \madx first searches for the periodic solution for the beam line
mentioned in LINE=beamline: The result is used as an initial condition
for the lattice function tracking. 

{\bf Example:} 
\madxmp{
xxxxxxxx\= \kill
CELL:   \>LINE=(...); \\
INSERT: \>LINE=(...); \\
USE, period=INSERT; \\
TWISS, LINE=CELL, DELTAP=0.0:0.003:0.001, CHROM, FILE;
}

For four values of DELTAP the following happens: First \madx finds the
periodic solution for the beam line CELL: Then it uses this solution as
initial conditions for tracking the lattice functions of the beamline
CELL: Output is also written on the file TWISS:  

If any of the beam lines was defined with formal arguments, actual
arguments must be provided:  
\madxmp{
CELL(SF,SD): \=LINE=(...); \\
INSERT(X):   \>LINE=(...); \\
USE, period=INSERT; \\
TWISS, LINE=CELL(SF1,SD1);
}

\section{Given Initial Values}

Initial values for \href{../Introduction/tables.html#linear}{linear
  lattice functions} and
\href{../Introduction/tables.html#chrom}{chromatic functions} may also
be numerical. Initial values can be specified on the TWISS command:  
\madbox{
TWISS,   \=BETX=real, ALFX=real, MUX=real,\\
         \>BETY=real, ALFY=real, MUY=real,\\
         \>DX=real, DPX=real, DY=real, DPY=real,\\
         \>X=real, PX=real, Y=real, PY=real,\\
         \>T=real, PT=real,\\
         \>WX=real, PHIX=real, DMUX=real,\\
         \>WY=real, PHIY=real, DMUY=real,\\
         \>DDX=real, DDY=real, DDPX=real, DDPY=real,\\
         \>R11=real, R12=real, R21=real, R22=real,  !coupling matrix\\
         \>TABLE=tablename,\\
         \>TOLERANCE=real,\\
         \>DELTAP=real:real:real;
}

All initial values for \href{../Introduction/tables.html#linear}{linear
  lattice functions} and
\href{../Introduction/tables.html#chrom}{chromatic functions} are
permitted, but BETX and BETY are required. Moreover, a
\href{beta0}{beta0} block can be added as filled by the
\href{../control/general.html#savebeta}{savebeta} command or see
below. The lattice parameters are taken from this block, but will be
overwritten by explicitly stated lattice parameters. As entered, the
initial conditions cannot depend on DELTAP, and can thus be correct only
for one such value.  

\section{SAVEBETA}
\label{sec:savebeta}
\madbox{
SAVEBETA, LABEL=string, PLACE=string, SEQUENCE=sequencename;
}
marks a location given by attribute \texttt{PLACE} in an expanded sequence "sequence\_name"; 
at the next \texttt{TWISS} command execution, a
\href{../twiss/twiss.html#beta0}{beta0} 
block will be saved at that location with the label given by the
attribute \texttt{LABEL}. 
This is done only once; in order to get a new beta0 block at the same
location in a subsequent \texttt{TWISS} command, the \texttt{SAVEBETA}
command  must be repeated.
The content of the beta0 block can then be used in other
commands, e.g. \texttt{TWISS} and \texttt{MATCH}.  

{\bf Example} (after sequence expansion): 
\madxmp{
SAVEBETA, LABEL=sb1, PLACE=mb[5], SEQUENCE=fivecell; \\
TWISS; \\
SHOW, sb1;
}
will save and show the beta0 block parameters at the end (!) of the
fifth element of type "mb" in the sequence.  


\section{SAVEBETA: Save Lattice Parameters}

Initial lattice parameters can be transfered for later commands, in
particular for twiss or the \href{../match/match.html}{match module}, by
using the \href{../control/general.html#savebeta}{savebeta} command
sequence.  

Parameters in tables can also be accessed 
using the \href{../Introduction/expression.html#table}{table access}
function. 
\begin{verbatim}
USE, period=...;
SAVEBETA, LABEL=name, PLACE=place, SEQUENCE=s_name;
TWISS,...;
\end{verbatim}

When reaching the \href{../control/general.html#place}{place} in the
sequence "s\_name" during execution of TWISS, \madx will save a
\hyperlink{beta0}{beta0} block with the
\href{../Introduction/label.html}{label} name: This block is filled with
the values of all lattice parameters in place.  

Example 1: 
\begin{verbatim}
USE, period=CELL;
SAVEBETA, LABEL=END, PLACE=#E, SEQUENCE=CELL;
TWISS;
USE, period=INSERT;
TWISS, BETA0=END;
\end{verbatim}
This first example calculates the \hyperlink{periodic}{periodic
  solution} of the line CELL, and then track lattice parameters through
INSERT, using all end conditions (including orbit) in CELL to start.  

Example 2: 
\begin{verbatim}
USE, period=CELL;
SAVEBETA, LABEL=END, PLACE=#E, SEQUENCE=CELL;
TWISS;
USE, period=INSERT;
TWISS, BETX=END-$>$BETY, BETY=END-$>$BETX;
\end{verbatim}
This is similar to the first example,but the beta functions are interchanged (overwritten).  

\section{BETA0: Set Initial Lattice Parameters}
\label{sec:beta0}
Initial lattice parameters can be set 'manually' for later commands, in
particular for \texttt{TWISS} or the \href{../match/match.html}{\texttt{MATCH} module}, by
using the \texttt{BETA0} command attached to a label.  

\madbox{
label: BETA0, \=BETX=real, ALFX=real, MUX=real,\\
              \>BETY=real, ALFY=real, MUY=real,\\
              \>\{etc for linear and chromatic lattice functions\} ;
}

A \texttt{BETA0} block can be used as a whole with all values declared,
as a block with overriden values explicitly, or by extracting single
values as shown in the three examples below:

Example of \texttt{BETA0} block used as a whole in \texttt{TWISS}: 
\madxmp{
initial: BETA0, \=BETX=10., ALFX=0.0, MUX=0.0, \\
                \>BETY=10., ALFY=0.0, MUY=0.0, \\
                \>DX=1., DPX=0.0;\\
TWISS, BETA0=initial;}

Example of \texttt{BETA0} block used as a whole but with overriden
values in the \texttt{TWISS} command:
\madxmp{
initial: BETA0, \=BETX=10., ALFX=0.0, MUX=0.0, \\
                \>BETY=10., ALFY=0.0, MUY=0.0, \\
                \>DX=1., DPX=0.0;\\
TWISS, BETA0=initial, ALFX=-0.1, ALFY=0.1;}

Example of using \texttt{BETA0} block by extracting single values in the
\texttt{TWISS} command:
\madxmp{
initial: BETA0, \=BETX=10., ALFX=0.0, MUX=0.0, \\
                \>BETY=10., ALFY=0.0, MUY=0.0, \\
                \>DX=1., DPX=0.0;\\
TWISS, BETX=initial-$>$BETX, BETY=initial-$>$BETY;}


%\input{Introduction/sectormap}
\subsection{Sectormap output}
\label{subsec:sectormap}
% Begin New version: Jean-Luc Nougaret, 18-Dec-2008 

The flag "sectormap" on the Twiss command (together with an element
selection via select,flag=sectormap,...) causes a file "sectormap" to be
written.   

For each user-selected element, it contains the user-selected coefficients of the kick vector 
\texttt{K} (6 values), of the first-order map 
\texttt{R} (6 x 6 values) and of the second-order map 
\texttt{T} (6 x 6 x 6 values)

The sector file is the output of a standard TFS table, which means that
the set of columns of interest may be selected through a SELECT command
as in the following example:  


\begin{verbatim}
select, flag=my_sect_table, column=name, pos, k1, r11, r66, t111;
\end{verbatim}


The sectormap file contains for each selected element, one element per line, the
set of chosen K, R, and T matrix coefficients: 
\\

\end{tabular}
\\
\\ 
Of course, the \texttt{select} statement can be combined with additional
options to filter-out the list of elements, such as in the following
statement, which for instance only retains drift-type elements:  

\begin{verbatim}
select, flag=my_sect_table, class=drift, column=name, pos, k1, r11, r66, t111;
\end{verbatim}



\texttt{K} coefficients range: 
\texttt{K1}... 
\texttt{K6}


\texttt{R} coefficients range: 
\\
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\texttt{R11} & ... & \texttt{R61} \\ 
\texttt{R12} & ... & \texttt{R62} \\ 
... & ... & ... \\ 
\texttt{R16} & ... & \texttt{R66}
\end{tabular}


\texttt{T} coefficients range: 
\\
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\texttt{T111} & ... &\texttt{T611} \\ 
\texttt{T121} & ... & \texttt{T621} \\ 
... & ... & ... \\ 
\texttt{T161} & ... & \texttt{T661} \\ 
\texttt{T112} & ... & \texttt{T612} \\ 
... & ... & ... \\ 
\texttt{T166} & ... & \texttt{T666}
\end{tabular}

 In the above notation, 
\texttt{Rij} stands for "effect on the 
\texttt{i}-th coordinate of the 
\texttt{j}-th coordinate in phase-space", whereas 
\texttt{Tijk} stands for "combined effect on the 
\texttt{i}-th coordinate of both the 
\texttt{j}-th and 
\texttt{k}-th coordinates in phase-space" along the lattice.

%  Commented by jluc, on 18 December 2008
% The flag "sectormap" on the Twiss command (together with an element
% selection via select,flag=sectormap,...) causes a file "sectormap" to
% be written. This is a fixed format file; per selected element it
% contains:
% 
% <pre>

The maps are the accumulated maps between the selected elements. They
contain both the alignment, and field errors present. Together with the
starting value of the closed orbit (which can be obtained from the
standard twiss file) this allows the user to track particles over larger
sectors, rather than element per element. A typical usage therefore lies
in the interface to other programs, such as TRAIN.  


%\input{threader/threader}
%%\title{Threader}

\section{Beam Threader}
\label{sec:threader}

In a machine with magnetic and alignment errors it can happen that the
beam does not circulate and the closed orbit cannot be established and
measured. This can also happen in \madx and the closed orbit finder does
not converge. 

The \texttt{THREADER} simulates beam steering through such a machine
with repeated measurement of trajectory over a certain number of
monitors and correction of the trajectory with upstream correctors.   

When enabled, threading is executed whenever a trajectory or closed
orbit search is carried out by the \href{../twiss/twiss.html}{TWISS}
module.   

The threader is controlled as an option. 
The following \madx commands enables the threader :
\madxmp{OPTION, THREADER;}
and the threader can be disabled with
\madxmp{OPTION, -THREADER;}

During the trajectory search in \texttt{TWISS}, or the first turn of the
orbit search for a closed machine, the threader calculates at each
monitor the difference between the present trajectory reading and a
reference value.   
If the difference exceeds a threshold (see below), the threader searches
backwards for the first corrector that will efficiently cancel the
difference and calculates the corresponding kick. The trajectory is then
recalculated starting again from that corrector and progressing
forward. The calculated kicks are added to already existing kicks. If
Twiss is searching for a closed orbit which involves tracking this
trajectory over many turns, the threader is only active during the first
turn.  

The reference value for the trajectory difference is zero by default but
can also be obtained from a previous orbit calculation if the current
{\tt Twiss} command has the {\tt useorbit} flag enabled and a previous
{\tt Twiss} command had the {\tt keeporbit} flag enabled. This allows
for example to thread the beam into a machine with orbit bumps present.  

The threshold values for triggering the threader correction can be set
with the command  
\madbox{
THREADER, VECTOR=\{xmax, ymax, att\};
}
where 
\begin{madlist}
  \ttitem{xmax, ymax} threshold orbit excursions beyond which the threader
  is applied. \\ Defaults: 0.005, 0.005
  \ttitem{att} attenuation factor for the kicks applied by the threader
  \\ Default: 1.0 
\end{madlist}

The attenuation factor defines the fraction of the calculated kick that
is actually applied by the threader.  
An attenuation factor of 0.5 will apply 50\% of the calculated kicks.

\section{Closed Orbit Guess}
\label{subsec:coguess}

In order to help the initial finding of the closed orbit by the
\texttt{TWISS} module, it is possible to specify an initial guess for
the coordinates of the fixed point at the start of the lattice.

\madbox{
COGUESS, \=X=real, PX=real, Y=real, PY=real, T=real, PT=real, \\
         \>TOLERANCE=real, \\
         \>CLEAR=logical;
}

The COGUESS command has the following attributes:
\begin{madlist}
  \ttitem{X, PX, Y, PY, T, PT} each parameter specified defines a first guess for all future closed orbit
  searches in case they are different from zero.  
  
  \ttitem{TOLERANCE} sets the required convergence precision in the closed
  orbit search. \\ (Default: 1.e-6)  
  
  \ttitem{CLEAR} a flag to reset the tolerance to its default value and to
  cancel the effect of a previous \texttt{COGUESS} in defining a first
  guess for subsequent closed orbit searches. \\ (Default:~false) 

\end{madlist}


\textbf{Example}\\
\madxmp{
COGUESS, X=1.e-3; \\
... \\
TWISS; \\
... \\
COGUESS, Y=-2.e-3; \\
... \\
TWISS; \\
... \\
COGUESS, CLEAR; \\
... \\
TWISS; \\
