\chapter{General Control Statements} 

\madx consists of a core program, and modules for specific tasks such as
twiss parameter calculation, matching, thin lens tracking, and so on.  
 
The statements listed here are those executed by the program core. They
deal with the I/O, element and sequence declaration, sequence
manipulation, statement flow control (e.g. IF, WHILE), MACRO
declaration, saving sequences onto files in \madx or \madeight format,
and so on.  


%% Moved to TWISS chapter
%% \subsection{COGUESS}
%% \label{subsec:coguess}

%% In order to help the initial finding of the closed orbit by the
%% {\tt TWISS} module, it is possible to specify an initial guess. 

%% \madbox{
%% COGUESS, \=TOLERANCE=real, \\
%%          \>X=real, PX=real, Y=real, PY=real, T=real, PT=real, \\
%%          \>CLEAR=logical;
%% }
%% sets the required convergence precision in the closed orbit search
%% ("tolerance", see as well Twiss command
%% \href{../twiss/twiss.html#tolerance}{tolerance}).  

%% The other parameters define a first guess for all future closed orbit
%% searches in case they are different from zero.  

%% The clear parameter in the argument list resets the tolerance to its default value 
%% and cancels the effect of coguess in defining a first guess for subsequent 
%% closed orbit searches. \\
%% Default = false, {\tt clear} alone is equivalent to {\tt clear=true}


\section{EXIT, QUIT, STOP}
\label{sec:exit}\label{sec:quit}\label{sec:stop}
Any of these three commands ends the execution of \madx:
\madbox{
EXIT;
}
\madbox{
QUIT;
}
\madbox{
STOP;
}


\section{HELP}
\label{sec:help}
The HELP command prints all parameters, and their defaults values, for
the statement given; this includes basic element types.
\madbox{
HELP, statement\_name;
}

\section{SHOW}
\label{sec:show}
The SHOW command prints the "command" (typically "beam", "beam\%sequ",
or an element name), with the actual value of all its parameters.  
\madbox{
SHOW, command;
}

\section{VALUE}
\label{sec:value}
The VALUE command evaluates the current value of all listed expressions,
constants or variables, and prints the result in the form of \madx
statements on the assigned output file. 
\madbox{
VALUE, expression\{, expression\} ;
}

Example: \\
\madxmp{
a = clight/1000.; \\
value, a, pmass, exp(sqrt(2));
}
results in 
\madxmp{
a = 299792.458         ; \\
pmass = 0.938272046        ; \\
exp(sqrt(2)) = 4.113250379        ; \\
}

\section{OPTION}
\label{sec:option}

The {\tt OPTION} commands sets the logical value of a number of flags
that control the behavior of \madx.

\madbox{
OPTION, flag=logical;
}

Because all attributes of {\tt OPTION} are logical flags, the
following two statements are identical:
\madxmp{
OPTION, flag = true;\\
OPTION, flag;
}
And the following two statements are also identical:
\madxmp{
OPTION, flag = false;\\
OPTION, -flag;
}

Several flags can be set in a single {\tt OPTION} command, e.g.
\madxmp{
OPTION, ECHO, WARN=true, -INFO, VERBOSE=false;
}

The available flags, their default values and their effect on \madx when
they are set to {\tt TRUE} are listed in table \ref{table:options}.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \caption{Flags available to {\tt OPTION} command}
  \vspace{1ex}
  \begin{center}
    \label{table:options}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|l|}
     \hline
     {\bf FLAG }  & {\bf default} & {\bf effect if {\tt TRUE}} \\
     \hline
     {\tt ECHO}  & true  & echoes the input on the standard output file \\
     {\tt WARN}  & true  & issues warning statements\\
     {\tt INFO}  & true  & issues information statements\\
     {\tt DEBUG} & false & issues debugging information \\
     {\tt ECHOMACRO} & false & issues macro expansion printout for debugging \\
     {\tt VERBOSE} & false & issues additional printout in makethin \\
     {\tt TRACE}   & false & prints the system time after each command \\
     {\tt VERIFY}  & false & issues a warning if an undefined variable is used 
     \\
     \hline
     {\tt TELL}  & false & prints the current value of all options \\
     {\tt RESET} & false & resets all options to their defaults \\
     \hline
     {\tt NO\_FATAL\_STOP} & false & Prevents madx from stopping in case of a 
     fatal error \\
                              &       & {\bf Use at your own risk !} \\
     \hline
     {\tt RBARC}     & true & converts the RBEND straight length into the arc 
     length \\
     {\tt THIN\_FOC} & true & enables the 1/(rho**2) focusing of thin dipoles \\
     {\tt BBORBIT}   & false & the closed orbit is modified by beam-beam kicks 
     \\
     {\tt SYMPL}     & false & all element matrices are symplectified in Twiss 
     \\
     {\tt TWISS\_PRINT} & true & controls whether the twiss command produces 
     output \\
     {\tt THREADER}  & false & enables the threader for closed orbit finding in 
     Twiss \\ 
                        &       & (see Twiss module) \\ 
     \hline
     \end{tabular}
   \end{center}
\end{table}

The option {\tt RBARC} is implemented for backwards compatibility
with \madeight up to version 8.23.06 included; in this version, the
RBEND length was just taken as the arc length of an SBEND with inclined
pole faces, contrary to the \madeight manual.  




\section{EXEC}
\label{sec:exec}
Each statement may be preceded by a label, when parsed and executed the
statement is then also stored and can be executed again with
\madbox{
EXEC, label;
}
This mechanism can be invoked any number of times, and the executed
statement may be calling another {\tt EXEC}, etc. 

Note however, that the main usage of this \madx construct is the
execution of a \href{special.html#macro}{macro}.   

\madxmp{
tw: TWISS, FILE, SAVE; ! first execution of TWISS \\
... \\
EXEC, tw; ! second execution of the same TWISS command \\
}


\section{SET}
\label{sec:set}
The {\tt SET} command is used in two forms:
\madbox{
SET, FORMAT=string \{, string\} ;\\
SET, SEQUENCE=string;
}


The first form of the {\tt SET} command defines the formats for the
output precision that \madx uses with the {\tt SAVE}, {\tt SHOW},
{\tt VALUE} and {\tt TABLE} commands. The formats can be
given in any order and stay valid until replaced. 

The formats follow the C convention and must be included in double
quotes. The allowed formats are \\
{\tt {\it n}d} for integers with a field-width = {\it n}, \\
{\tt {\it n}.{\it m}f} or {\tt {\it n}.{\it m}g} or {\tt {\it
    n}.{\it m}e} for floats with field-width = {\it n} and precision =
       {\it m}, \\
{\tt {\it n}s} for strings with a field-width = {\it n}.\\
The default is "right adjusted", a "-" changes it to "left adjusted".

{\bf Example:}\\
\madxmp{
SET, FORMAT="12d", "-18.5e", "25s";
}

%% \begin{verbatim}
%% "nd" for integer with n = field width.
%% \end{verbatim}
%% \begin{verbatim}
%% "m.nf" or "m.ng" or "m.ne" for floating, m field width, n precision.
%% \end{verbatim}
%% \begin{verbatim}
%% "ns" for string output.
%% \end{verbatim} 


The default formats are {\tt "10d", "18.10g"} and {\tt "-18s"}.

Example: 
\begin{verbatim}
set,format="22.14e";
\end{verbatim} 
changes the current floating point format to 22.14e; the other formats remain untouched. 
\begin{verbatim}
set,format="s","d","g";
\end{verbatim} 
sets all formats to automatic adjustment according to C conventions. 



The second form of the {\tt SET} command allows to select the
current sequence without the "USE" command, which would
bring back to a bare lattice without errors. The command only works
if the chosen sequence has been previously activated with a {\tt USE} command,
otherwise a warning is issued and \madx continues with the
unmodified current sequence. This command is particularly useful for
commands that do not have the sequence as an argument like "EMIT" or
"IBS". 



\section{SYSTEM}
\label{sec:system}
\madbox{
SYSTEM, "string";
}
transfers the quoted string to the system for execution. The quotes are
stripped and no check of the return status is performed bt \madx.

{\bf Example:}\\ 
\madxmp{
SYSTEM,"ln -s /afs/cern.ch/user/j/joe/public/some/directory shortname";
}
makes a local link to an AFS directory with the name "shortname" on a
UNIX system. 

Attention: Although this command is very convenient, it is clearly not portable
across systems and should probably avoid it if you intend to share \madx scripts with
collaborators working on other platforms. 

\section{TITLE}
\label{sec:title}
\madbox{
TITLE, "string";
}
the string in quotes is inserted as title in various table outputs and
plot results.  


\section{USE}
\label{sec:use}
\madx operates on beamlines that must be loaded and expanded in memory
before other commands can be invoked. The {\tt USE} allows this
loading and expansion.

\madbox{
USE, \=PERIOD=sequence\_name, SEQUENCE=sequence\_name, \\
     \>RANGE=range, \\
     \>SURVEY=logical;
}

The attributes to the {\tt USE} command are:
\begin{madlist}
  \ttitem{SEQUENCE} name of the sequence to be loaded and expanded. 
  \ttitem{PERIOD} name of the sequence to be loaded and expanded. \\ 
  {\tt PERIOD} is an alias to {\tt SEQUENCE} that was kept for
  backwards compatibility with \madeight and only one of them should be
  specified in a {\tt USE} statement. 
  \ttitem{RANGE} specifies a \hyperref[sec:range]{range}.   
  restriction so that only the specified part of the named sequence is
  loaded and  expanded.
  \ttitem{SURVEY} option to plug the survey data into the sequence elements
  nodes on the first pass (see \hyperref[chap:survey]{\tt SURVEY}).
\end{madlist}

Note that reloading a sequence with the {\tt USE} command reloads a
bare sequence and that any {\tt ERROR} or orbit correction previously
assigned or associated to the sequence are forgotten. 
A mechanism to select a sequence without this side effect of the
{\tt USE} command is provided with the {\tt SET, SEQUENCE=...} command.


\section{SELECT} 
\label{sec:select}

Some \madx commands can perform specific operations on selected elements
or ranges of elements and can produce specific output for selected
elements or ranges of elements. 

The selection is made through the {\tt SELECT} command and applies to
subsequent commands.

\madbox{
SELECT, \=FLAG=string, RANGE=string, CLASS=string, PATTERN=string, \\
        \>SEQUENCE=string, FULL=logical, CLEAR=logical,\\
        \>COLUMN=string\{,string\},  SLICE=integer, THICK=logical;
} 

The attributes to the {\tt SELECT} command are:
\begin{madlist}
  \ttitem{FLAG} determines the applicability of the
         {\tt SELECT} statement and the attribute value can be one of
         the following:
     \begin{madlist}
       \ttitem{SEQEDIT} selection of elements for the
       \hyperref[sec:seqedit]{\tt SEQEDIT} module.
       
       \ttitem{ERROR} selection of elements for the
       \hyperref[chap:error]{error assignment} module.
       
       \ttitem{MAKETHIN} selection of elements for the
       \hyperref[chap:makethin]{\tt MAKETHIN} command that
       converts the sequence into one with thin elements.
       
       \ttitem{SECTORMAP} selection of elements for the
       \hyperref[subsec:sectormap]{\tt SECTORMAP} output file
       from the \hyperref[chap:twiss]{\tt TWISS} module.
       
       \ttitem{SAVE} selection of elements for the
       \hyperref[sec:save]{\tt SAVE} command.
       
       \ttitem{tablename} is a table name such as {\tt twiss}, 
       {\tt track} etc., and the rows and columns to be written are
       selected.
     \end{madlist} 
     
  \ttitem{RANGE} the range of elements to be selected as defined in
  section \ref{sec:range} on \hyperref[sec:range]{range} selection.

  \ttitem{CLASS} the class of elements to be selected as defined in
  section \ref{sec:class} on \hyperref[sec:class]{class} selection.

  \ttitem{PATTERN} the regular expression pattern for the element names
  to be selected as defined in section \ref{sec:regex} on selection via
  \hyperref[sec:regex]{regular expressions}. 

  \ttitem{SEQUENCE} the name of a sequence to which the selection is applied.

  \ttitem{FULL} a logical falg to select ALL positions in the sequence
  for the named flag. \\
  For the flag {\tt TWISS}, this attribute includes all standard
  columns for a {\tt TWISS} table, and therefore the following two
  statements are equivalent:
  \madxmp{
SELECT, FLAG=twiss, COLUMN= name, s, betx, ..., var1; \\
SELECT, FLAG=twiss, FULL, COLUMN= var1; 
  } 
  {\tt FULL=true} is the default for the {\tt MAKETHIN} flag and for tables: 
  {\sl eg} {\tt SELECT, FLAG=makethin;} is equivalent to {\tt SELECT,
    FLAG=makethin, FULL;}  
  
  \ttitem{CLEAR} deselects ALL positions in the sequence for the flag
  "name". This is the default for {\tt ERROR} and {\tt SEQEDIT}
  flags. \\
  {\sl eg} {\tt SELECT, FLAG=error;} is equivalent to {\tt SELECT, FLAG=error, CLEAR;}

  \ttitem{COLUMN} is only valid for tables and takes as attribute value
  a list of columns to be written into the TFS file. The special "\_name"
  argument refers to the actual name of the element. 
  %For an example, see \hyperref[sec:select]{\tt SELECT}.  

  \ttitem{SLICE} is the number of slices into which the selected
  elements have to be cut and is only used by
  \hyperref[chap:makethin]{\tt MAKETHIN}. (Default = 1). 

  \ttitem{THICK} is a logical flag to indicate  whether the selected
  elements are treated as thick elements by the \hyperref[chap:makethin]{\tt
    MAKETHIN} command. \\ 
  This only applies up to now to \hyperref[sec:quadrupole]{\tt
    QUADRUPOLE}s and \hyperref[sec:bend]{\tt BEND}s for which thick maps
  have been explicitely derived. 
\end{madlist}

\vskip 5mm
{\bf Composition of {\tt SELECT} statements:} \\
The selection criteria provided on a single {\tt SELECT} statement are logically
{\tt AND}ed, {\sl ie} selected elements have to fulfill {\bf all}
provided criteria in the single {\tt SELECT} statement.  

The selection criteria on different {\tt SELECT} statements are logically
{\tt OR}ed, {\sl ie} selected elements have to fulfill {\bf any} of the
selection criteria provided by the different {\tt SELECT} statements.   

All selections for a given flag remain valid until a {\tt SELECT} statement
with the {\tt CLEAR} argument is specified for the same flag.

Note that because of these composition rules, it is considered good
practice to start by clearing the selection for a given flag before
making a new selection, eg: 
\madxmp{ 
SELECT, FLAG=twiss, CLEAR; \\
SELECT, FLAG=twiss, CLASS=MQ; \\
SELECT, FLAG=twiss, RANGE=MQ[5]/MQ[7]; \\
...
}


\vskip 5mm
{\bf Examples:} 
\madxmp{ 
SELECT, FLAG = ERROR, CLASS = quadrupole, RANGE = mb[1]/mb[5];\\
SELECT, FLAG = ERROR, PATTERN = "\textasciicircum mqw.*";
}
selects all quadrupoles in the range mb[1] to mb[5], as well as all
elements (in the whole sequence) with name starting with "mqw", for 
treatment by the \hyperref[chap:error]{\tt ERROR} module.  

\vskip 5mm
\madxmp{
SELECT, FLAG=SAVE, CLASS=variable, PATTERN="abc.*"; \\
SAVE, FILE=mysave;
}
saves all variables (and sequences) containing "abc" in their name, 
but does not save elements with names containing "abc" since the class
"variable" does not exist.  

\vskip 5mm
\madxmp{
sig1 := sqrt(beam->ex*table(twiss,betx)); \\
SELECT, FLAG=twiss, COLUMN= \_name, s, betx, ..., sig1; ! or equivalently \\
SELECT, FLAG=twiss, FULL, COLUMN= sig1; ! default columns + new
}
writes the current value of ``sig1'' into the {\tt TWISS} table each
time a new line is added; Note that the values from the same (current)
line can be are accessed by the variable ``sig1''.
The \hyperref[chap:plot]{\tt PLOT} command also accepts the new variable 
in the table.
