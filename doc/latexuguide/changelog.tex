\textbf{since version 5.02.00}

The following changes have been made to the code and documentation since
August 15th, 2014 in version 5.02.02

The changes are indexed by the SVN release number. 

\begin{madlist}

  \ttitemn{r4932} 2014-Aug-18, version 5.02.03 \\
  a single element can now be repeated in a beamline expansion:
  \texttt{2*S} and \texttt{-2*S} are of course identical (single
  elements are not reversed head to tail), and also equivalent to
  \texttt{2*(S)} and \texttt{-2*(S)} if \texttt{S} is a single
  element.\\
  Documentation updated; see \ref{sec:reflect_repeat_lines}


  \ttitem{r4942, r4943} 2014-Aug-25, version 5.02.03 \\
  harmonized the behaviour of \hyperref[sec:fill]{\tt FILL},
  \hyperref[sec:setvars]{\tt SETVARS} and \hyperref[sec:setvars_lin]{\tt
    SETVARS\_LIN} with respect to negative row numbers, and updated the
  default values. Added documentation sections for {\tt SETVARS} and {\tt
    SETVARS\_LIN} that were hitherto undocumented.  


  \ttitem{r4947} 2014-Aug-27, version 5.02.03 \\
  changed the behaviour of \hyperref[sec:fill]{\tt FILL} to accept as
  parameter a row number equal to the current number of rows in the
  table plus one, with the effect of creating a new row and filling it. 


  \ttitem{r5013} 2014-Oct-14, version 5.02.03\\
  fixed a documented feature of \hyperref[chap:survey]{\tt SURVEY} where
  the first {\tt KSL} component of thin \hyperref[sec:multipole]{\tt
    MULTIPOLE} elements, representing a vertical angle for a thin
  dipole, was not taken into account. Both {\tt KNL} and {\tt KSL} are
  now properly taken into account. Another change was to make {\tt
    SURVEY} take into account the \hyperref[sec:rfmultipole]{\tt
    RFMULTIPOLE} elements in the same way that it treats {\tt MULTIPOLE}
  elements.
  

  \ttitem{r5078} 2014-Nov-13, version 5.02.04\\
  fixed figure \ref{F-YSDISP} where the {\it x}-axis was pointing in
  the wrong direction and the orientation of the element for positive
  {\tt DPHI} was also not conforming to the text for the
  \hyperref[sec:ealign]{\tt EALIGN} command.
