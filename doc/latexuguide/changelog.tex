\begin{madlist}

  \ttitemn{r4932} 2014-Aug-18, version 5.02.03 \\
  a single element can now be repeated in a beamline expansion:
  \texttt{2*S} and \texttt{-2*S} are of course identical (single
  elements are not reversed head to tail), and also equivalent to
  \texttt{2*(S)} and \texttt{-2*(S)} if \texttt{S} is a single
  element.\\
  Documentation updated; see \ref{sec:reflect_repeat_lines}


  \ttitem{r4942, r4943} 2014-Aug-25, version 5.02.03 \\
  harmonized the behaviour of \hyperref[sec:fill]{\tt FILL},
  \hyperref[sec:setvars]{\tt SETVARS} and \hyperref[sec:setvars_lin]{\tt
    SETVARS\_LIN} with respect to negative row numbers, and updated the
  default values. Added documentation sections for {\tt SETVARS} and {\tt
    SETVARS\_LIN} that were hitherto undocumented.  


  \ttitem{r4947} 2014-Aug-27, version 5.02.03 \\
  changed the behaviour of \hyperref[sec:fill]{\tt FILL} to accept as
  parameter a row number equal to the current number of rows in the
  table plus one, with the effect of creating a new row and filling it.
