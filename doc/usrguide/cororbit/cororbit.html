<h1>Orbit Correction</h1>

This chapter describes the commands which can be used to correct  
the closed orbit or a trajectory.
The distorted orbit is taken from an internal or external TFS table.

Purpose of this Module:                             
</font>
<br>
The purpose of this orbit module is to provide some basic tools to assess the performance
of an orbit correction system of a machine in the design phase.
<br>
Although some interface is available, it cannot and does not provide the full functionality
expected from a dedicated online orbit correction and steering program.
