<h1>Activate/Deactivate Correctors or Monitors</h1>

To provide more flexibility with orbit correction two
commands are provided:
<pre>
USEMONITOR, STATUS=flag,
            [,SEQUENCE=sequence][,RANGE=range][,CLASS=class][,PATTERN=regex]
USEKICK,    STATUS=flag,
            [,SEQUENCE=sequence][,RANGE=range][,CLASS=class][,PATTERN=regex]
</pre>
The purpose of the two commands is:
<ul>
<li><a name="monitor">USEMONITOR</a>:
Activates or deactivates a selection of
<a href="../Introduction/monitors.html">beam position monitor</a>s.
This command affects elements of types MONITOR, HMONITOR, or VMONITOR.
<li><a name=kick>USEKICK</a>:
Activates or deactivates a selection of
<a href="../Introduction/kickers.html">orbit correctors</a>.
This command affects elements of types KICKER, HKICKER, or VKICKER.
</ul>
Both commands have the same attributes:
<ul>
<li>STATUS:
If this flag is true (on), the selected elements are activated.
Active orbit monitor readings will be considered,
and active correctors can change their strengths in subsequent correction
commands.
Inactive elements will be ignored subsequently.
<li>SEQUENCE:
The sequence can be specified, otherwise the currect sequence is
used for this operation.
<li>RANGE, CLASS, PATTERN:
The usual selection commands are used to identify the elements   
for this operation.
</ul>

<pre>
USE,...                          ! set working beam line 
...                              ! define imperfections 
USEKICK,STATUS=OFF,RANGE=...;    ! deactivate selected correctors 
USEMONITOR,STATUS=OFF,RANGE=...; ! deactivate selected monitors   
CORRECT,NCORR=32;                ! uses different set of correctors
USEKICK,STATUS=OFF,RANGE=...;    ! deactivate different set of correctors 
CORRECT,NCORR=32;                ! uses different set of correctors
