<h2>Edit a Beam Line Sequence</h2>
</center>
<p>
With the help of the commands explained below, a sequence may be modified
in many ways: the starting point can be moved to another place; the
order of elements can be inverted; elements can be inserted one by one,
or as a whole group with one single command; single elements, or classes
thereof can be removed; elements can be replaced by others; finally, the
sequence can be "flattened", i.e. all inserted sequences are replaced by
their actual elements, such that a flattened sequence contains only
elements. It is good practice to add a <font color=ff0000><i>
flatten; </i></font> statement at the end of a <font color=ff0000><i>
seqedit operation </i></font> to ensure a fully operational
sequence. And this is particularly useful for the <font color=ff0000><i>
save </i></font> command to properly save <font
color=ff0000><i> shared sequences </i></font> and to
write out in <font color=ff0000><i> MAD-8 </i></font> format.

<p>
<ul>
<li><h4><a name=seqedit>SEQEDIT</a></h4>
<pre>
seqedit, sequence=s_name;
</pre> selects the sequence named for editing. The editing is
performed on the non-expanded sequence; after having finished the
editing, one has to re-expand the sequence if necessary.
<p>
<p>
<li><h4><a name=extract>EXTRACT</a></h4>
<pre>
extract,sequence=s_name,from=MARKER_1,to=MARKER_2,newname=p;
</pre>
A new sequence with name "p" is extracted from the existing sequence named "s_name", 
starting from MARKER_1 and ending at MARKER_2. 
The new sequence "p" can be USEd as any other sequence. 
It is declared as "shared" and can therefore be combined 
e.g. into the cycled original sequence.<br>
Note that MARKER_1 must be located before MARKER_2 in the existing sequence "s_name", 
or MAD-X will fail with a fatal error. 
In the case of circular sequences, this can be ensured by performing a CYCLE 
of sequence "s_name" with START=MARKER_1.
<p>
<li><h4><a name=flatten>FLATTEN</a></h4>
<pre>
flatten;
</pre>
This command includes all sequences in the sequence being edited, if any.
The resulting sequence contains only elements.
<p>
<li><h4><a name=install>INSTALL</a></h4>
<pre>
install, element=name,class=class_name,at=real,from=place|selected;
</pre>
where the parameters have the following meaning:
<ul>
<li>element: name of the (new) element to be inserted (mandatory)
<li>class: class of the new element to be inserted (mandatory)
<li>at: position where the element is to be inserted; if no "from"
is given,this is relative to the start of the sequence. If "from"
is given, it is relative to the position specified there.
<li>from:either a place (i.e. the name(+occurrence count) of an
element already existing in the sequence, e.g. mb[15], or mq.a..i1..4 etc.;
or the string "selected"; in this latter case an element of the type
specified will be inserted behind all elements in the sequence that are
currently selected by one or several
<a href="../Introduction/select.html">SELECT</a> commands of the type
<pre>
select,flag=seqedit,class=.., pattern=.., range=..;
</pre>
<li><font color=ff0000><i>
Attention: No element definitions inside seqedit. </i></font><p>
</ul><li><h4><a name=move>MOVE</a></h4>
<pre>
move, element=name|selected,by=real,to=real,from=place;
</pre>
<ul>
<li>element: name of the existing element to be moved, or "selected", in
which case all elements from existing 
<a href="../Introduction/select.html">SELECT</a> commands will be
moved; in the latter case, "by" must be given.
<li>by: amount by which the element(s) is/are to be moved; no "to" nor
"from" in this case.
<li>to: position to which the element has to be moved; if no from,
then this is relative to the start of the sequence; otherwise, it is
relative to the place given in "from".
<li>from: place in the sequence with respect to which the element is
to be positioned.
</ul>
<p>
<li><h4><a name=remove>REMOVE</a></h4>
<pre>
remove, element=name|selected;
</pre>
<ul>
<li>element: name of the existing element to be removed, or
"selected", in which case all elements from existing 
<a href="../Introduction/select.html">SELECT</a> commands will be
removed.
<font color=ff0000><i>
<li>Attention: It is a bad idea to remove all markers from a sequence!
In particular the "start=" marker and the new markers added by "cycle"
must never be removed from a sequence.</i></font>
<p>
</ul><li><h4><a name=cycle>CYCLE</a></h4>
<pre>
cycle,start=place;
</pre>
This makes the sequence start at the place given, which must be a marker.
<p>
In the case there is a shared sequence in the used sequence, the 
command FLATTEN has to be used before the command CYCLE. Example:
<p>
    flatten ; cycle,start=place;
<p>
<p>
<li><h4><a name=reflect>REFLECT</a></h4>
<pre>
reflect;
</pre>
This inverts the order of element in the sequence, starting from the
last element.
<p>
If there are shared sequences inside the USEd sequence, the command
FLATTEN must be used before the command REFLECT.  Alternatively each
shared sequence must first be reflected. Example: 
<p>
    flatten ; reflect;
<p>
<p>
<li><h4><a name=replace>REPLACE</a></h4>
<pre>
replace,element=name1|selected,by=name2;
</pre>
Element with name1 is replaced by element with name2. If name1 is
"selected", then all elements selected by
<a href="../Introduction/select.html">SELECT</a> commands will be
replaced by the element name2.
<p>
<li><h4><a name=endedit>ENDEDIT</a></h4>
<pre>
endedit;
</pre>
terminates the sequence editing process. The nodes in the sequence are
renumbered according to their occurrence which might have changed
during editing.
