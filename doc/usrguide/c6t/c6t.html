<h2>SixTrack: Produce input files for tracking in SixTrack</h2>
</center>

In dynamic aperture studies <a
href="../Introduction/bibliography.html#SixTrack">[SixTrack]</a> is often used because of its 
speed and controllability. However the input files are notoriously difficult 
to produce by hand. This command may be used to produce SixTrack files from 
a sequence in MAD-X's memory. 
</P>
N.B.: The files contain all information concerning optics, field errors 
and misalignments. Hence these should all be set and a 
<PRE>TWISS,SAVE;</PRE>
command should always be issued beforehand.
</P>
The generation of the SixTrack input files is then done by the command:
<PRE>
SIXTRACK, CAVALL,
          MULT_AUTO_OFF,
          MAX_MULT_ORD,
          SPLIT,
	  APERTURE,
          RADIUS = ref. radius of magnets;
</PRE>
The parameters are defined as:
<ul>
<li> CAVALL - (optional flag) This puts a cavity element (SixTrack identifier
12) with Volt, Harmonic Number and Lag attributes at each location in
the machine. Since for large hadron machines the cavities are
typically all located at one particular spot in the machine and since
many cavities slow down the tracking simulations considerably all
cavities are lumped into one and located at the first appearance of a
cavity. This default is enforced by omitting this flag.
<li> MULT_AUTO_OFF - (optional flag, default = .FALSE.) If .TRUE. this
module does not process zero value multipoles. Moreover, multipoles
are prepared in SixTrack (file fc.3) to be treated up to the order as
specified with <font color=ff0000><i>MAX_MULT_ORD</i></font>.
<li> MAX_MULT_ORD - (optional parameter, default = 11) Process up to this order for
<font color=ff0000><i> mult_auto_off = .TRUE.</i></font>.
<li> SPLIT  - (optional flag) OBSOLETE. This splits all the elements in 
two. This is for backwards compatibilty only. The user should now use the 
<A HREF="../makethin/makethin.html">MAKETHIN</A>
command instead.
<li> APERTURE - (optional flag) Set this to convert the apertures from MAD-X
to SixTrack, so SixTrack will track with aperture.
<li> RADIUS - (optional, default value is 1m). This sets the reference 
radius for the magnets. This argument is optional but should normally 
be set.
<li><font color=ff0000><i> Note: the bv flag is presently ignored</i></font>
<li><font color=ff0000><i> WARNING: SixTrack and c6t are presently set
up for names of a maximum of 16 characters!!!!!
Therefore, it is mandatory to respect this limit for MAD-X names.</i></font>
</UL>

The command will then always produce the following file:
<ul>
<li> fc.2 - contains the basic structure of the lattice.
</UL>
and may produce any or all of the following files, depending on 
the sequence:
<ul>
<li> fc.3 - contains the multipole mask(s).
<li> fc.3.aux - contains various beam parameters.
<li> fc.8 - contains the misalignments and tilts.
<li> fc.16 - contains the field errors and/or combined multipole kicks.
<li> fc.34 - file with various optics parameters at various locations (not needed by SixTrack but may be used as input to <a
href="../Introduction/bibliography.html#SODD">[SODD]</a>.)
</ul>

For a full description of these files see <a
href="../Introduction/bibliography.html#SixTrack">[SixTrack]</a> and for information on running SixTrack see  <a
