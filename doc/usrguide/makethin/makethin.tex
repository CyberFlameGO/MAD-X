\subsection{MAKETHIN: Slice a sequence into thin lenses}
%%\end{center}
 This module converts a sequence with thick elements into one composed entirely of thin elemtens as required by the default MAD-X tracking. 
 
 Slicing is done by the MAKETHIN command: 
\begin{verbatim}

MAKETHIN,SEQUENCE=sequence name,
         STYLE=slicing style;
\end{verbatim} The parameters are defined as: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item SEQUENCE chooses the sequence you wish to slice. 
	\item STYLE (optional) chooses the slicing style. The options are:   
\begin{itemize}
	\item SIMPLE : this is a simplified slicing algorithm which produces any number of equal strength slices at equidistant positions with the kick in the middle of each slice.     
	\item COLLIM : this is the default slicing for collimators. If only one slice is  chosen it is placed in the middle of the old element. If two slices are chosen they  are placed at either end. Three slices or more are treated as one slice.     
	\item TEAPOT : this is the slicing algorithm described in \href{../Introduction/bibliography.html#TEAPOT}{[TEAPOT]} but generalized to any number of slices.     
	\item      (default): this is the standard default slicing for all elements (except collimators). It uses TEAPOT if the number of slices $\leq$ 4, and SIMPLE otherwise.    
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{By default} all elements are converted to one thin element positioned at the center of  the thick element. To get a greater slicing for certain elements use a standard SELECT command with FLAG=MAKETHIN and  CLASS, RANGE or PATTERN: 
\begin{verbatim}

SELECT,FLAG=MAKETHIN,
       CLASS=class,RANGE=range,
       SLICE=no of slices;
\end{verbatim}  The created thin lens sequence has the following properties: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item The created sequence has the same name as the original. The original is therefore no longer  available and has to be reloaded if it is needed again.  
	\item The slicer also slices any inserted sequence used in the main sequence. These are also given the same names as the originals. 
	\item Any component changed into a single thin lens has the same name as the original. 
	\item If a component is sliced into more than one slice, the individual slices have the same name as the original component and a suffix \texttt{..1}, \texttt{..2}, etc... and a marker  will be placed at the center with the original name of the component. 
\end{itemize}  Hints: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item See the \href{http://cern.ch/frs/mad-X_examples/makethin/}{examples} for makethin. 
	\item Compare the optics before and after slicing with makethin. Consider to increase the number of slices and rematch after makethin to \textbf{reach the required accuracy}. 
	\item Consider to replace rbend by sbend + thin quads taking into account the edge focusing before slicing with makethin. 
	\item The selection works on the current sequence. Consider to insert a "USE,SEQUENCE=.." before SELECT 
\end{itemize}
