<h2>MAKETHIN: Slice a sequence into thin lenses</h2>
</center>

This module converts a sequence with thick elements into one composed of
thin (zero length) element slices or simplified thick slices as required
by MAD-X tracking or conversion to SIXTRACK input format.

The slicing is performed by the command: 
<pre>
MAKETHIN,SEQUENCE=seq_name,
         STYLE=slicing_style,
         MINIMIZEPARENTS= ??, MAKECONSISTENT= ??, MAKEDIPEDGE= ??; 
</pre>
The parameters are defined as:
<ul>
  <li>SEQUENCE= seq_name is the name of the sequence to be
    processed to thin slices. The sequence must be active, i.e. it should
    have been previously loaded with a USE command.  

  <li>STYLE= slicing_style where the argument is optional, 
    selects the slicing style. Available slicing styles are:     
    <UL>
      <LI>SIMPLE : is a simplified slicing algorithm which produces
	equal strength slices at equidistant positions with the kick in the
	middle of each slice. <br>
	It is the default if the number of slices is larger than 4. 
	
      <LI>COLLIM : is the default slicing for collimators. If only
	one slice is  chosen it is placed in the middle of the old
	element. If two slices are chosen they  are placed at either
	end. Three slices or more are treated as one slice.      
	
      <LI>TEAPOT : is the improved slicing algorithm described in
	<a href="../Introduction/bibliography.html#TEAPOT">[TEAPOT]</a> and
	generalized to any number of slices. <br>
	It is the default if the number of slice is less or equal to 4.
	
      <LI> (parameter not given): The standard default slicing for all
	elements (except collimators). It uses TEAPOT if the number
	of slices is less or equal to 4, and SIMPLE otherwise.
    </ul>
  <li> MINIMIZEPARENTS: to be documented
  <li>MAKECONSISTENT: to be documented
  <li>MAKEDIPEDGE: to be documented
</ul>
<p>

<b>Note:</b> It is strongly recommended to always specify STYLE=teapot  
to use the improved slicing for any number of slices.


<!-- <span style="font-weight: bold;">By default</span> all elements are converted to one thin element positioned at the center of  the thick element. -->
<!-- To get a greater slicing for certain elements use a standard SELECT command with FLAG=MAKETHIN and  -->
<!-- CLASS, RANGE or PATTERN: -->
<!-- <pre> -->
<!-- SELECT,FLAG=MAKETHIN, -->
<!--        CLASS=class,RANGE=range, -->
<!--        SLICE=no of slices; -->
<!-- </pre> -->

<p>
The number of slices can be set individually for elements or groups of
elements using
<a href="http://mad.web.cern.ch/mad/madx.old/Introduction/select.html">SELECT</a>
commands
<pre>
SELECT, FLAG=makethin, 
        RANGE=range, CLASS=class, PATTERN=pattern[,FULL][,CLEAR],
        THICK=logical, SLICE=integer;
</pre>

where the argument to the parameter SLICE is the number of
slices for the selected elements. <br>
The default is one slice and THICK=false for all elements, 
i.e. conversion of all thick elements to a single thin slice 
positioned at the centre of the original thick element.
<p>

<b>Restrictions:</b>
<ul>
  <li> makethin requires that the sequence makes use of the default
  positioning of elements (REFER=centre). 
  <li> THICK=true only applies to dipole or quadrupole magnet
  elements and is ignored otherwise.  
</ul>
<p>

The generated thin lens sequence has the following properties: 
<ul>
  <li> The new sequence has the same name as the original. The original sequence
  is replaced by the new one in memory. If the original sequence is
  needed for further processing in MAD-X, it should be reloaded.
  <li> The algorithm also slices any sub-sequence inserted in the main
  sequence. These sub-sequences are also given the same names as the originals. 
  <li> Any element transformed into a single thin lens element has the
  same name as the original. 
  <li> If an element is sliced into more than one slice, the individual
  slices have the same basename as the original element plus a suffix 
  <tt>..1</tt>, <tt>..2</tt>, etc. and a marker, with the name of the original
  element, is placed at the location of the center of the original element.
</ul>
<p>

<b>Hints:</b><br> 
<ul>
   <li> See the
     <a href="http://cern.ch/frs/mad-X_examples/makethin/">examples</a> 
     for makethin.  
   <li> Compare the optics before and after slicing with makethin. 
     Consider to increase the number of slices and rematch
     after makethin to <b>reach the required accuracy</b>.  
   <li> Consider to replace rbend by sbend + thin quads taking into
     account the edge focusing before slicing with makethin.  
   <li> The selection works on the current sequence. Consider to insert
     a "USE,SEQUENCE=.." before SELECT  
</ul>
<p>

<b> Enhanced options, implemented in 2013</b><br>
<ul>
  <li> Slicing can be turned off for certain elements or classes by specifying
    a number of slices < 1. Examples:
<pre>
! turn off slicing for sextupoles
select, flag=makethin, class=sextupole, slice=0; 

! keep elements unchanged with names starting by mbxw
select, flag=makethin, pattern=mbxw\., slice=0; 
</pre><p>
This option allows to introduce slicing step by step and monitor the
resulting changes in optics parameters.

<!-- Note that subsequent tracking generally requires full slicing, with possible exception of quadrupoles and bending magents. -->

<li><b>Thick quadrupole slices</b>
  Makethin has been upgraded in 2013 to allow for thick quadrupole slicing
  with insertion of markers between thick slices. 
  Positioning is done with markers between slices, here however with thick
  slice quadrupole piece filling the whole length. 
  Examples:
<pre>
! slice quadrupoles thick, insert 2 markers per quadrupole
select, flag=makethin, class=quadrupole, thick=true, slice=2; 

! thick slicing for quadrupoles named mqxa, insert one marker in the middle
select, flag=makethin, pattern=mqxa\., slice=1,  thick=true; 
</pre>

<li><b>Automatic dipedge generation for bending magnets:</b>
  Makethin has been upgraded in 2013 to automatically generated dipedges
  at the start and/or end of bending magnets, to conserve edge focusing
  from pole face angles <tt>e1, e2</tt> or extra fields described by 
  <tt>fint, fintx</tt>, in the slicing of bending magnets to thin
  multipole slices. <br>
  Selection with <tt>THICK=true</tt> will translate a complex thick 
  <tt>rbend</tt> or <tt>sbend</tt> including edge effects to a simple thick 
  sbend in which the edge focusing is transferred to extra dipedges. 
  <br> Example:
<pre>
!  keep translated rbend as thick sbend
select, flag=makethin, rbend, thick=true;
</pre>
</ul>
<p>

<b>Hints:</b><br>
<!-- % Makethin should be considered as a tool to automatically translate a -->
<!-- % thick sequence as relevant for matching and twiss, into a sequence -->
<!-- % which can be used as input for tracking. The   -->
<ul>
  <li> Compare the main optics parameters like tunes before and after slicing
    with makethin. 
  <li> In tests, turn off slicing for some of the main element classes to
    identify the main sources of changes. 
  <li> For sextuples and octupoles, a single slice should always be sufficient.
  <li> Increase the number of slices for critical elements like mini-beta
    quadrupoles. Even there, more than four slices should rarely be
    required. 
  <li> Rematch tunes and chromaticity after makethin. 
</ul>
