<h2>MAKETHIN: Slice a sequence into thin lenses</h2>
</center>

This module converts a sequence with thick elements into one composed of
thin (zero length) element slices or simplified thick slices as required
by MAD-X tracking or conversion to SIXTRACK input format.

<p><b><u>Slicing to thin elements</u></b><p> 

The slicing is performed by the command: 
<pre>
MAKETHIN,SEQUENCE=seq_name, STYLE=slicing_style,
         MAKEDIPEDGE= logical; 
         MINIMIZEPARENTS= logical, 
         MAKECONSISTENT= logical; 
</pre>
The parameters are defined as:
<ul>
  <li>SEQUENCE= seq_name is the name of the sequence to be
    processed to thin slices. The sequence must be active, 
    i.e. it should have been previously loaded with a USE command. 
    The sequence must use the default positioning of elements 
    (REFER=centre)  

  <li>STYLE= slicing_style where the argument is optional, 
    selects the slicing style. Available slicing styles are:     
    <UL>
      <LI>SIMPLE : produces equal strength slices at equidistant 
	positions with the kick in the 	middle of each slice. <br>
	It is the default if the number of slices is larger than 4. 
	
      <LI>TEAPOT : improves the slice positioning using the algorithm 
	described in
	<a href="http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/AccelConf/IPAC2013/papers/mopwo027.pdf">IPAC'13 MOPWO027</a>
	<br>
	It is the default if the number of slice is less or equal to 4.
	
      <LI>COLLIM : is the default slicing for collimators. If only
	one slice is chosen it is placed in the middle of the old
	element. If two slices are chosen they are placed at either
	end. Three slices or more are treated as one slice.      
	
      <LI> (parameter not given): The standard default slicing for all
	elements (except collimators). It uses TEAPOT if the number
	of slices is less or equal to 4, and SIMPLE otherwise.
    </ul>
    <b>Note:</b> It is strongly recommended to always specify STYLE=teapot  
    to use the improved slicing for any number of slices.

  <li>MAKEDIPEDGE is a flag that controls the generation of
   DIPEDGE elements at the start and/or end of bending magnets,
   to conserve edge focusing from pole face angles <tt> e1, e2</tt>
   or extra fields described by <tt> fint, fintx</tt>, in the
   process of slicing bending magnets to thin multipole slices.   
   Selection with <tt>THICK=true</tt> will translate a complex thick 
   <tt>RBEND</tt> or <tt>SBEND</tt>, including edge effects, to a simple
   thick <tt>SBEND</tt> with edge focusing transferred to extra 
   <tt>DIPEDGE</tt> elements. <br>
   (Default: <tt>MAKEDIPEDGE= false</tt>) <br>
   Example:
<pre>
!  keep translated rbend as thick sbend
select, flag=makethin, rbend, thick=true;
</pre>


  <li>MINIMIZEPARENTS is a flag that controls the removal of
   inconsistent numbers of slices for parent elements. <br>
   (Default: <tt>MINIMIZEPARENTS= true</tt>)


  <li>MAKECONSISTENT is a flag to ensure an equal number of slices
   for parent and children elements, using the larger value. <br>
   (Default: <tt>MAKECONSISTENT= false</tt>)

</ul>

<p><b><u>Number of slices</u></b><p>

The number of slices can be set individually for elements or groups of
elements using
<a href="http://mad.web.cern.ch/mad/madx.old/Introduction/select.html">SELECT</a>
commands
<pre>
SELECT, FLAG=makethin, 
        RANGE=range, CLASS=class, PATTERN=pattern[,FULL][,CLEAR],
        THICK=logical, SLICE=integer;
</pre>
where the argument to the parameter SLICE is the number of
slices for the selected elements. <br>
The default is one slice and THICK=false for all elements, 
i.e. conversion of all thick elements to a single thin slice 
positioned at the centre of the original thick element.
<p>
Note that <tt>THICK=true</tt> only applies to dipole or quadrupole magnet
elements and is ignored otherwise.  
<p>
MAKETHIN allows for thick quadrupole slicing with insertion of
markers between thick slices. Positioning is done with markers between
slices, here however with thick slice quadrupole piece filling the whole
length.  <br>  
Examples:
<pre>
! slice quadrupoles thick, insert 2 markers per quadrupole
select, flag=makethin, class=quadrupole, thick=true, slice=2; 

! thick slicing for quadrupoles named mqxa, insert one marker in the middle
select, flag=makethin, pattern=mqxa\., slice=1,  thick=true; 
</pre>
<p>
Slicing can be turned off for certain elements or classes by specifying
a number of slices < 1. Examples: 
<pre>
! turn off slicing for sextupoles
select, flag=makethin, class=sextupole, slice=0; 

! keep elements unchanged with names starting by mbxw
select, flag=makethin, pattern=mbxw\., slice=0; 
</pre>
This option allows to introduce slicing step by step and monitor the
resulting changes in optics parameters.
<br>
Keep in mind however  that subsequent tracking generally requires full slicing, with
possible exception of quadrupoles and bending magents. 

<p><b><u>Additional Information</u></b><p>

The generated thin lens sequence has the following properties: 
<ul>
  <li> The new sequence has the same name as the original. The original sequence
  is replaced by the new one in memory. If the original sequence is
  needed for further processing in MAD-X, it should be reloaded.
  <li> The algorithm also processes any sub-sequence inserted in the main
  sequence. These sub-sequences are also given the same names as the original ones. 
  <li> Any element transformed into a single thin lens element has the
  same name as the original. 
  <li> If an element is sliced into more than one slice, the individual
  slices have the same basename as the original element plus a suffix 
  <tt>..1</tt>, <tt>..2</tt>, etc. and a marker, with the name of the original
  element, is placed at the location of the center of the original element.
</ul>
<p>

<b>Hints:</b><br> 

<ul>
  <li> Compare the main optics parameters like tunes before and after slicing
    with MAKETHIN. Rematch tunes and chromaticity as necessary after
    MAKETHIN. 

  <li>In tests, turn off slicing for some of the main element classes to
    identify the main sources of changes. 

  <li>For sextuples and octupoles, a single slice should always be sufficient.

  <li>Increase the number of slices for critical elements like mini-beta
    quadrupoles. Even there, more than four slices should rarely be
    required. 

  <li> In case of problems or doubts, consider to

      flatten</a> the sequence before slicing.
