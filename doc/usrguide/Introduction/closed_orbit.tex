\section{Closed Orbit}

Due to various errors like misalignment errors, field errors, fringe
fields etc., the closed orbit does not coincide with the reference
orbit. It also changes with the momentum error. The closed orbit is
described with respect to the reference orbit, using the local
reference system (\textit{x, y, s}). It is evaluated including any
nonlinear effects.  

MAD also computes the betatron and synchrotron oscillations with respect
to the closed orbit. Results are given in the local (\textit{x, y,
  s})-system defined by the reference orbit.
