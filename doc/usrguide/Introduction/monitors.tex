\subsection{Beam Position Monitors}
%%\end{center}
  A beam monitor acts on the beam like a drift space. In addition it serves to record the beam position for closed orbit corrections. Four different types of beam position monitors are recognised: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \href{hmon}{HMONITOR}. Monitor for the horizontal beam position, 
	\item \href{vmon}{VMONITOR}. Monitor for the vertical beam position, 
	\item \href{mon}{MONITOR}. Monitor for both horizontal and vertical beam position. 
	\item \href{inst}{INSTRUMENT}. A place holder for any type of beam instrumentation. Optically it behaves like a drift space; it returns \emph{no beam observation}. It represent a class of elements which is completely independent from drifts and monitors. 
\end{itemize}
\begin{verbatim}

label: HMONITOR,    L=real;
label: VMONITOR,    L=real;
label: MONITOR,     L=real;
label: INSTRUMENT,  L=real;
\end{verbatim} A beam position monitor has one real attribute: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item L: The length of the monitor (default: 0 m). If the length is different from zero, the beam position is recorded in the centre of the monitor. 
\end{itemize} Examples: 
\begin{verbatim}

MH: HMONITOR,L=1;
MV: VMONITOR;
\end{verbatim} The \href{local_system.html#straight}{straight reference system} for a monitor is a cartesian coordinate system.
