<H2>Bending Magnets</H2>
</center>
<p>
Two different type keywords are recognised for bending magnets,
they are distinguished only by the reference system used:
<UL>
<LI><a name=rbend>RBEND</a> is a rectangular bending magnet.
It has parallel pole faces and is based on a curved
<a href="local_system.html#rbend">rbend reference system</a>; 
<b><font color="#ff0000">
its length is the straight length as in the Figure but
internally the arc length is being used. 
- to define an RBEND with the arc length as length (straight line
shorter than input - for compatibility with MAD8 version up to
version 8.23.06 including), the option RBARC=FALSE has to be set.</font></b>
<p><LI><a name=sbend>SBEND</a> is a sector bending magnet.
Its pole faces meet at the centre of curvature of the curved
<a href="local_system.html#sbend">sbend reference system</a>.
</UL>
They are defined by the commands:
<PRE>
SBEND,   L=real,ANGLE=real,TILT=real,K0=real,K0S=real,K1=real,E1=real,E2=real,
         FINT=real,FINTX=real,HGAP=real,K2=real,H1=real,H2=real;

RBEND,   L=real,ANGLE=real,TILT=real,K0=real,K0S=real,K1=real,E1=real,E2=real,
         FINT=real,FINTX=real,HGAP=real,K2=real,H1=real,H2=real;
</PRE>
For both types,
the following first-order attributes are permitted:
<UL>
<LI>L:
The length of the magnet (default: 0 m).
For a rectangular magnet the length is measured along a straight line 
as in the Figure (internally the arc length is used), while for a 
sector magnet it is the arc length of the reference orbit.
<b><font color="#ff0000">
To define an RBEND with the arc length (shorter straight length), 
the option RBARC=FALSE has to be set.</font></b>
<p><LI>ANGLE:
The bend angle (default: 0 rad).
A positive bend angle represents a bend to the right,
i.e. towards negative <VAR>x</VAR> values.
<p><LI>TILT:
The roll angle about the longitudinal axis (default: 0 rad,
i.e. a horizontal bend). A positive angle represents a clockwise
rotation. A TILT=pi/2 turns a horizontal into a vertical bend, i.e. a
positive bend ANGLE denotes a deflection down.
<b><font color="#ff0000"> Please note that contrary to MAD8 one has to
specify the desired TILT angle, otherwise it is taken as 0 rad. This
was needed to avoid the confusion in MAD8 about the actual meaning of
the TILT attribute for various elements.
</b></font>
<p><b>
<LI>Please take note that K<sub>0</sub> and K<sub>0s</sub> are left in
the data base but are no longer used for the MAP of the bends (but see
below for what K<sub>0</sub> is being used), instead ANGLE and TILT
are used exclusively. We believe that this will allow for a clearer
and unambiguous definition, in particular in view of the upcoming
integration of MAD-X with PTC which will allow a more general
definition of bends. <font color="#ff0000"> However, it is required to
specify k0 to assign RELATIVE field errors to a bending magnet since
k0 is used for the normalization and NOT the ANGLE. (see
EFCOMP).</b></font>
<p>
<!---<PRE>K0: -->
<!---The horizontal dipole coefficient -->
<!---<i>K<sub>0</sub> = (1 / B rho) B<sub>y</sub> </i>. -->
<!---The default is 0 m<sup>-1</sup>. -->
<!---A positive dipole strength is equivalent to a positive ANGLE which has the -->
<!---precedence over K<sub>0</sub>; however, if ANGLE is omitted,  -->
<!---K<sub>0</sub>*L is used instead. -->
<!---K0S: -->
<!---The vertical dipole coefficient -->
<!---<i>K<sub>0s</sub> = (1 / B rho) B<sub>x</sub> </i>. -->
<!---The default is 0 m<sup>-1</sup>. A positive K0S deflects the closed -->
<!---orbit to positive y values.</PRE> -->
<LI>K1:
The quadrupole coefficient
<p>
<i>K<sub>1</sub> = (1 / B rho) (del B<sub>y</sub> / del x)</i>.
<p>
The default is 0 m<sup>-2</sup>.
A positive quadrupole strength implies horizontal focussing
of positively charged particles.
<LI>E1:
The rotation angle for the entrance pole face
(default: 0 rad).
<LI>E2:
The rotation angle for the exit pole face
(default: 0 rad).
<LI>FINT:
The field integral whose default value is 0.
<LI>FINTX:
Allows (FINTX > 0)to set FINT at the element exit different from its entry
value. In particular useful to switch it off (FINTX=0).
<LI>HGAP:
The half gap of the magnet (default: 0 m).
</UL>
The pole face rotation angles are referred to the magnet model for
<a href="local_system.html#rbend">rectangular bend</a> and
<a href="local_system.html#sbend">sector bend</a> respectively.
The quantities FINT and HGAP specify
the finite extent of the fringe fields as defined in
<a href="bibliography.html#slac75">[SLAC-75]</a>
There they are defined as follows:
<p>
<img src="../equations/fint_hgap.gif" alt="(see SLAC-75)" align=bottom>
<p>
The default values of zero corresponds to the hard-edge approximation,
i.e. a rectangular field distribution.
For other approximations, enter the correct value of the half gap,
and one of the following values for FINT:
<PRE>
Linear Field drop-off                     1/6
Clamped "Rogowski" fringing field         0.4
Unclamped "Rogowski" fringing field       0.7
"Square-edged" non-saturating magnet      0.45
</PRE>
Entering the keyword FINT alone sets the integral to 0.5.
This is a reasonable average of the above values.

The following second-order attributes are permitted:
<ul>
<LI>K2:
The sextupole coefficient
<i>K<sub>2</sub> = (1 / B rho) (del<sup>2</sup> B<sub>y</sub> / del x<sup>2</sup>)</i>.
<LI>H1:
The curvature of the entrance pole face (default: 0 m<sup>-1</sup>).
<LI>H2:
The curvature of the exit pole face (default: 0 m<sup>-1</sup>).
A positive pole face curvature induces a negative sextupole component;
i.e. for positive H1 and H2
the centres of curvature of the pole faces are placed inside the magnet.
</UL>
Examples:
<PRE>
BR: RBEND,L=5.5,ANGLE=+0.001;              // Deflection to the right
BD: SBEND,L=5.5,K0S=+0.001/5.5;            // Deflection up
BL: SBEND,L=5.5,K0=-0.001/5.5;             // Deflection to the left
BU: SBEND,L=5.5,K0S=-0.001;                // Deflection down
