<h1>Element Classes</h1>

The concept of element classes solves the problem of addressing
instances of elements in the accelerator in a convenient manner.
It will first be explained by an example.
All the quadrupoles in the accelerator form a class QUADRUPOLE.
Let us define three subclasses for the focussing quadrupoles,
the defocussing quadrupoles, and the skewed quadrupoles:
<pre>
MQF: QUADRUPOLE,L=LQM,K1=KQD;     ! Focussing quadrupoles
MQD: QUADRUPOLE,L=LQM,K1=KQF;     ! Defocussing quadrupoles
MQT: QUADRUPOLE,L=LQT;            ! Skewed quadrupoles
</pre>
These classes can be thought of as new keywords which define
elements with specified default attributes.
We now use theses classes to define the real quadrupoles:
<pre>
QD1: MQD;           ! Defocussing quadrupoles
QD2: MQD;
QD3: MQD;
 ...
QF1: MQF;           ! Focussing quadrupoles
QF2: MQF;
QF3: MQF;
 ...
QT1: MQT,K1S=KQT1;   ! Skewed quadrupoles
QT2: MQT,K1S=KQT2;
 ...
</pre>
These quadrupoles inherit all unspecified attributes from their class.
This allows to build up a hierarchy of objects with a rather
economic input structure.
<p>
The full power of the class concept is revealed when object classes
are used to select instances of elements for various purposes.
Example:
<pre>
select,flag=twiss,class=QUADRUPOLE; ! Select all quadrupoles for the
                                    ! Twiss TFS file
</pre>
<p>
More formally, for each element keyword MAD maintains a
class of elements with the same name.
A defined element becomes itself a class which can be used
to define new objects,
which will become members of this class.
A new object inherits all attributes from its class;
but its definition may override some of those values by new ones.
All class and object names can be used in range selections,
providing a powerful mechanism to specify positions
for matching constraints and printing.
