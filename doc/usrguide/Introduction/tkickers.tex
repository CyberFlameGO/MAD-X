\section{Transverse Kicker}

The type TKICKER should be used to create horizontal, vertical or
combined transverse kickers physically equivalent to elements of type
KICKER, but \textbf{not used} by the closed orbit correction module (see
\href{../cororbit/co_correct.html}{CORRECT} command).   

Examples of elements that may use the type TKICKER: 
\begin{itemize}
   \item Fast kickers for injection, dump \& tune
   \item Magnetic septa towards beam dump
   \item Dampers of transverse beam oscillations
   \item Undulator \& Wiggler magnets
\end{itemize}

For further information on element type TKICKER and its attributes, look
at the documentation of the orbit corrector type
\href{kickers.html#kick}{KICKER}.
