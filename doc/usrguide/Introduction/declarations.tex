\subsection{Variable Declarations}
\label{subsec:var_declarations}

In the following, "=" means that the variable at the left receives the
current value of the expression at right, but does not depend on it any
further, whereas ":=" makes it depend on this expression, i.e. every
time the expression changes, the variable is re-evaluated, except for
"const" variables.  

\begin{verbatim}
var = expression;
var := expression;
real var = expression;        // identical
real var := expression;       // to above
int var = expression;         // truncated if expression is real
int var := expression;
const var = expression;
const var := expression;
const real var = expression;        // identical
const real var := expression;       // to above
const int var = expression;         // truncated if expression is real
const int var := expression;
\end{verbatim}
