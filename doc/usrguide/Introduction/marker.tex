\section{Marker}

\begin{verbatim}
label: MARKER;
\end{verbatim} 
The simplest element which can occur in a beam line is the MARKER. It
has no effect on the beam, but it allows one to identify a position in
the beam line, for example to apply a matching constraint.  

Example: 
\begin{verbatim}
m27: marker;
\end{verbatim}
