<h2>Defining aperture in MAD-X</h2>
</center>

A new feature of MAD-X is the ability to set an aperture for a particular 
element, or parent of a set of elements. This removes the need of placing a
collimator next to every element to do aperture tracking.

The aperture of any elements can be specified (excepts drifts) by the use of the following parameters:
<UL>
<LI><TT>APERTYPE</TT> This can have seven text values: CIRCLE,
RECTANGLE, ELLIPSE, LHCSCREEN (a superposition of a CIRCLE and a
RECTANGLE), MARGUERITE (two LHCSCREENS, one rotated by 90 degrees), 
RECTELLIPSE (a superposition of an ELLIPSE and a RECTANGLE) and RACETRACK.
<LI><TT>APERTURE</TT> This is an array of values, the number and meaning 
of which depends on the APERTYPE:

</TABLE>
</UL>

Here is an example for setting an ELLIPTICAL aperture for the main
dipoles for the LHC.
<pre>
MB : SBEND, L := l.MB, APERTYPE=ELLIPSE, APERTURE={0.02202,0.02202};
</pre>
And an example for setting a FILENAME aperture for another magnet. Notice that no aperture parameters are needed.
<pre>
MB: SBEND, L := 5, APERTYPE=myfile;
</pre>
The syntax of myfile should be like this:
<pre>
x0   y0
xi   yi
...
xn   yn
</pre>

Notes concerning the use of aperture:
<UL>
<LI>There is some inconsistency in the parameter definition for the
different APERTYPE. This is historical and has to be kept for
backwards compatibility. <font color=ff0000>Pay some attention to the
parameters you introduce!</font>  
<LI>When <A HREF="../makethin/makethin.html">MAKETHIN</A> is called all the 
thin slices inherit the aperture from their original thick lens version.
<LI>When the SIXTRACK command is called (see the SixTrack converter
module <A HREF="../c6t/c6t.html">C6T</A>) the apertures are ignored by
default. To convert the apertures as well the APERTURE flag has to be
set. <LI> Aperture parameters are like all parameters and are
inherited by offspring. Like other parameters they can also be
overridden by the offspring elements if necessary.
</UL>

The APERTYPE and the APERTUREs themselves can be conveniently added to
the TWISS table (see <a href="../twiss/twiss.html">Twiss Module</a>) by
using the <a href="select.html">SELECT</a> command. E.G. the command: 
<font color=ff0000>
<pre>
select,flag=twiss,clear;
select,flag=twiss,column=name,s,betx,alfx,mux,bety,alfy,muy,apertype,aper_1,aper_2;
</pre>
</font>
and a subsequent TWISS command will put the aperture information
together with the specified TWISS parameters into the TWISS table.

<center>
<h2>Defining tolerances in MAD-X</h2>
</center>
A parameter closely connected to the aperture is the sum of the mechanical and alignment tolerances. The mechanical tolerance is the maximal error margin of errors in the element body which causes a decrease of aperture, and the alignment tolerance is a mislignment of the element in the accelerator, which also causes a decrease of aperture. The tolerance is given in the transverse plane as a racetrack, like in the picture below.<br>
<IMG SRC=tolerance.jpg align=center width="450"><br>
A tolerance can be assigned to each element in a MAD-X sequence as a vector:
<pre>
Syntax: APER_TOL = {r, g, s};

MB : SBEND, L := l.MB, APER_TOL={1.5, 1.1, 0};
</pre>

<center>
<h2>APERTURE MODULE</h2>
</center>
Computes the n1 values for a piece of machine. Each element is sliced into thick subelements at given intervals, and the available aperture is computed at the end of each slice. The computation is based on the last Twiss table, so it is important to run the <a href="../twiss/twiss.html">Twiss</a> and aperture commands on the same period or sequence, see the aperture example below. Also showed in the example is how n1 values can be <a href="../plot/plot.html">plotted</a>. 
<p>
The minimum n1 for each element is written to the last Twiss table, to allow for <a href="../match/match.html">matching</a> by aperture.

</ul>
<p>

<h3>Not simply connex beam pipes</h3>
Methodically, the algorithm for finding the largest possible halo is fairly simple. The distance from halo centre to the first apex (i = 0) in the halo is calculated (l_i), and the equation for a line going through these points is derived. This line is then compared with all lines making the pipe polygon to find their respective intersection coordinates. The distance h_i between halo centre and intersection are then divided by l_i, to find the maximal ratio of enlargement, as seen below. This procedure is then repeated for all apexes i in the halo polygon, and the smallest ratio  of all apexes is the maximal enlargement ratio for this halo to just touch the pipe at this particular longitudinal position.<br>
<IMG SRC=notsimple0.jpg align=center width="420"><br>

There is one complication to this solution; polygons which are not simple connexes. (Geometrical definition of ``simply connex'': A figure in which any two points can be connected by a line segment, with all points on the segment inside the figure.) The figure below shows what happens when a beam pipe polygon is not a simple connex. The halo is expanded in such a way that it overlaps the external polygon in the area where the latter is dented inwards.<br>
<IMG SRC=notsimple1.jpg align=center width="420" height="420"><br>

To make the module able to treat all kinds of polygons, <I>notsimple</I> must be activated. With this option activated, apexes are strategically added to the halo polygon wherever the beam pipe polygon might have an inward dent. This is done by drawing a line from halo centre to each apex on the pipe polygon. An apex with its coordinates on the intersection point line-halo is added to a table of halo polygon apexes. The result is that the halo polygon has a few ``excessive'' points on straight sections, but the algorithm used for expansion will now never miss a dent in the beam pipe. The use of the notsimple option significantly increases computation time.<br>

<h3>Trueprofile file syntax</h3>
This file contains magnet names, and their associated displacements of the axis for 
an arbitrary number of S, where So is the start of the magnet and Sn the end. The interval between each S must be regular, and X and Y 
must be given in meters. The magnet name must be identical to how it appears in the 
sequence. The displacements are only valid for this particular magnet, and cannot be 
assigned to a family of magnets. n1 is calculated for a number of slices determinated by the number of Si.<br>

<h3>Offsetelem file syntax</h3>
This file contains coordinates describing how certain elements are displaced w.r.t. a 
given reference point in the machine. It might be used with elements in insertions, or other special-purpose elements that has a magnet axis which does not coincide with the reference trajectory. We operate with two coordinate system, s,x and s,y, where the reference point is the origin and the actual element axis is described as a parabola with coefficients A, B and C. For each element we give two sets of coefficients, one for horizontal displacement and one for vertical: <pre>X_offs(s) = Ax*s^2 + Bx*s + Cx </pre>and <pre>Y_offs(s) = Ay*s^2 + By*s + Cy</pre>. The coordinate systems are in meters.

As an example we see in the picture below how the horizontal axes of elements m1 and m2 does not coincide with the reference trajectory.
<IMG SRC=offsetelem.jpg align=center width="780" height="420"><br>
The X_ref(s) and Y_ref(s) of the reference trajectory are calculated via an internal call to the <a href="../survey/survey.html">Survey</a> module. X_offs(s) and Y_offs(s) are derived from the coefficients given in the file. The resulting <pre>X_tot(s) = X_ref(s) - X_offs(s)</pre> and <pre>Y_tot(s) = Y_ref(s) - Y_offs(s)</pre> are taken into account in the aperture calculations.

<h2>Aperture command example</h2>
</center>
<p>
The aperture module needs a Twiss table to operate on. It is important 
not to USE another period or sequence between the Twiss and aperture 
module calls, else aperture looses its table. One can choose the ranges 
for Twiss and aperture freely, they need not be the same.
<p>
<pre>use, period=lhcb1;
select, flag=twiss,range=mb.a14r1.b1/mb.a17r1.b1,column=keyword,name,parent,k0l,k1l,s,betx,bety,n1;
twiss, file=twiss.b1.data, betx=beta.ip1, bety=beta.ip1, x=+x.ip1, y=+y.ip1, py=+py.ip1;
plot,haxis=s,vaxis=betx,bety,colour=100;

select, flag=aperture, column=name,n1,x,dy;
aperture, range=mb.b14r1.b1/mb.a17r1.b1, spec=5.235;
plot,table=aperture,noline,vmin=0,vmax=10,haxis=s,vaxis=n1,spec,on_elem,style=100;
</pre>
<p>
The <a href="../Introduction/select.html">select</a> command can be 
used to choose which columns to print in the output file. 
<br>
Column names:
name, n1, n1x_m, n1y_m, apertype,
aper_1, aper_2, aper_3, aper_4,
rtol, xtol, ytol,
s, betx, bety, dx, dy, x, y,
on_ap, on_elem, spec
<p>
n1 is the maximum beam size in sigma, while n1x_m and n1y_m is the n1 values in si-units in the x- and y-direction.
<p>
aper_# means for all apertypes but racetrack:<br>
aper_1 = half width rectangle<br>
aper_2 = half heigth rectangle<br>
aper_3 = half horizontal axis ellipse (or radius if circle)<br>
aper_4 = half vertical axis ellipse<p>
For racetrack, the aperture parameters will have the same meaning as the tolerances:<br>
aper_1 and xtol = horizontal displacement of radial part <br>
aper_2 and ytol = vertical displacement of radial part <br>
aper_3 and rtol = radius <br>
aper_4 = not used
<p>
On_elem indicates whether the node is an element or a drift, and on_ap 
whether it has a valid aperture. The Twiss parameters are the interpolated 
values used for aperture computation.
<p>
When one wants to plot the aperture, the table=aperture parameter is 
necessary. The normal line of hardware symbols along the top is not 
compatible with the aperture table, so it is best to include 
noline. Plot instead the column on_elem along the vaxis to have a 
simple picture of the hardware. Spec can be used for giving a limit 
value for n1, to have something to compare with on the plot. This example 
provides a plot,
<p>
<IMG SRC=aperexample.jpg align=center width="740" height="620">
<p>
where we see the n1, beta functions and the hardware symbolized by on_elem.
