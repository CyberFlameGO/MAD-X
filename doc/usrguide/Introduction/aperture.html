<h2>Defining aperture in MAD-X</h2>
</center>

The aperture for a particular element or class of elements can be set in MAD-X 
at the time of definition or instantiation of the element or class.
<br>
During tracking the particle excursion is then checked against the defined aperture and 
the particle is lost if it is outside the defined aperture.
<br>
The aperture can be specified for any element or class of elements, 
with the exception of drift spaces. 
<br>
The definition of the aperture takes the following form and parameters:
<UL>
<LI><TT> ..., APERTYPE=string,  APERTURE={values}</TT><p>
<LI><TT>APERTYPE</TT> defines the aperture type from a set of seven preselected types: <p>
CIRCLE, RECTANGLE, ELLIPSE, <br>
RECTCIRCLE, a superposition of an CIRCLE and a RECTANGLE, <br>
LHCSCREEN, an alias for RECTCIRCLE,
RECTELLIPSE, a superposition of an ELLIPSE and a RECTANGLE, <br>
and RACETRACK.<br>
Note that the MARGUERITE aperture type (two RECTCIRCLEs crossing at right angle) is no longer supported. <br>
<p>
<LI><TT>APERTURE</TT> is an array of values, the number and meaning 
of which depends on the APERTYPE:<p>
<TABLE border="1">
<TR><TH>APERTYPE</TH>   <TH># of values</TH> <TH>meaning of values</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>CIRCLE</TD>     <TD>1</TD> <TD>radius of circle</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>ELLIPSE</TD>    <TD>2</TD> <TD>horizontal and vertical semi-axes of ellipse</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>RECTANGLE</TD>  <TD>2</TD> <TD>half width and half height of rectangle</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>RECTCIRCLE</TD> <TD>3</TD> <TD>half width and half height of rectangle, radius of circle</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>LHCSCREEN</TD>  <TD>3</TD> <TD>half width and half height of rectangle, radius of circle</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>RECTELLIPSE</TD><TD>4</TD> <TD>half width and half height of rectangle, horizontal and vertical semi-axes of ellipse</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>RACETRACK</TD>  <TD>3</TD> <TD>horizontal and vertical offsets (g and s) of the circle center, radius (r) of the circular part (see figure below)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>filename</TD>   <TD>0</TD> <TD>where the file contains a list of x and y coordinates outlining the shape. This option is only supported by the aperture module, see below.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</UL>

<b>Examples:</b><p>
The following sets an ELLIPTICAL aperture for the main
dipoles for the LHC.
<pre>
MB: SBEND, L=l.MB, APERTYPE=ELLIPSE, APERTURE={0.02202,0.02202};
</pre>

When the aperture is specified in a specific file the only aperture parameter is the filename:
<pre>
MB: SBEND, L=l.MB, APERTYPE=myfile;
</pre>
where "myfile" contains the list of x-y coordinates defining the aperture shape:
<pre>
x0   y0
xi   yi
...
xn   yn
</pre>

<b>Notes:</b>
<UL>
<LI>There are inconsistencies in the parameter definition for the
different aperture types. This is historical and is kept for
backwards compatibility. 
<font color=ff0000>Pay some attention to the parameters you introduce!</font>  

<LI>When <A HREF="../makethin/makethin.html">MAKETHIN</A> is called all 
thin slices inherit the aperture of their respective original thick lens version.

<LI>When the SIXTRACK command is called (see the SixTrack converter
module <A HREF="../c6t/c6t.html">C6T</A>) the apertures are ignored by
default. To convert the apertures as well the APERTURE flag has to be
set in C6T. 

<LI> Aperture parameters are like all parameters and are
inherited by derived elements. Like other parameters they can also be
overridden by the derived elements if necessary.
</UL>

The APERTYPE and the APERTUREs themselves can be conveniently added to
the TWISS table (see <a href="../twiss/twiss.html">Twiss Module</a>) by
using the <a href="select.html">SELECT</a> command. For example the command: 
<font color=ff0000>
<pre>
select,flag=twiss,clear;
select,flag=twiss,column=name,s,betx,alfx,mux,bety,alfy,muy,apertype,aper_1,aper_2;
</pre>
</font>
and a subsequent TWISS command will put the aperture information
together with the specified TWISS parameters into the TWISS table.

<center>
<h2>Defining tolerances in MAD-X</h2>
</center>
A parameter closely connected to the aperture is the sum of the mechanical and alignment tolerances. 
The mechanical tolerance is the maximal error margin of errors in the element body which 
causes a decrease of aperture, and the alignment tolerance is a mislignment of the element 
in the accelerator, which also causes a decrease of aperture. 
The tolerance is given in the transverse plane as a racetrack, 
like in the picture below.
<br>
<IMG SRC=tolerance.jpg align=center width="450">
<br>
A tolerance can be assigned to each element in a MAD-X sequence as a vector:
<pre>
Syntax: APER_TOL = {r, g, s};

MB : SBEND, L := l.MB, APER_TOL={1.5, 1.1, 0};
</pre>

<center>
<h2>APERTURE MODULE</h2>
</center>
<b>The APERTURE module was developped specifically for the LHC. 
Default parameter values are LHC values and the physics 
in APERTURE assumes ultra-relativistic particles. </b>
<p>
The APERTURE module computes the n1 values for a piece of machine. 
Each element is sliced into thick subelements at given intervals, 
and the available aperture is computed at the end of each slice. 
The computation is based on the last Twiss table, so it is important to run 
the <a href="../twiss/twiss.html">Twiss</a> and aperture commands on the same 
period or sequence, see the aperture example below. 
Also showed in the example is how n1 values can be <a href="../plot/plot.html">plotted</a>. 
<p>
The minimum n1 for each element is written to the last Twiss table, 
to allow for <a href="../match/match.html">matching</a> by aperture.

<pre>
APERTURE, RANGE=range,
          EXN=real, EYN=real, DQF=real, DPARX=real, DPARY=real, 
          BETAQFX=real, BBEAT=real, DP=real, 
          COR=real,  NCO=integer, 
          HALO={real,real,real,real}, HALOFILE=filename,
          INTERVAL=real, SPEC=real, NOTSIMPLE=logical, 
          TRUEPROFILE=filename, OFFSETELEM=filename, 
          FILE=filename;  
</pre>
where the parameters have the following meaning:
<ul>
<li>RANGE: <a href="../Introduction/ranges.html">Range</a> given by 
elements. Default = #s/#e

<li>EXN: Normalised horizontal emittance. Default = 3.75*e-6
<li>EYN: Normalised vertical emittance. Default = 3.75*e-6

<li>DQF: Peak linear dispersion [m]. Default = 2.086
<li>DPARX: Fractional horizontal parasitic dispersion. Default = 0.273
<li>DPARY: Fractional vertical parasitic dispersion. Default = 0.273
<li>BETAQFX: Beta x in standard qf [m]. Default = 170.25
<li>BBEAT: Beta beating coefficient applying to beam size. Default = 1.1
<li>DP: Bucket edge at the current beam energy. Default = 0.0015

<li>COR: Maximum radial closed orbit uncertainty [m]. Default = 0.004

<li>NCO: Number of azimuth for radial scan. Default = 5

<li>HALO: Halo parameters: {n, r, h, v}. n is the radius of the primary halo, 
r is the radial part of the secondary halo, h and v is the horizontal and 
vertical cuts in the secondary halo. Default = {6, 8.4, 7.3, 7.3}

<li>HALOFILE: Input file with halo polygon coordinates. Will suppress 
an eventual halo parameter. Default = none

<li>INTERVAL: Approximate length in meters between measurements. Actual value: 
nslice = nodelength/interval, nslice is rounded down to closest integer, 
interval = nodelength/nslice. Default = 1.0

<li>SPEC: Aperture spec, for plotting only. Gives the spec line in the plot. Default = 0.0

<li>NOTSIMPLE: Use only if one or more beamscreens in the range are considered not to 
be a "simply connex". Since all MAD-X apertypes are simply connex, this is only possible 
if an input file with beam screen coordinates are given. See below for a graphical example. Default = false.

<li>TRUEPROFILE: A file containing a list of magnets, and for each magnet a list of 
horizontal and vertical deviations from the ideal magnet axis. 
These values may come from measurements done on the magnet. 
See below for example. Default = none.

<li>OFFSETELEM: A file containing a reference point in the machine, 
and a list of magnets with their offsets from this point described as a parabola. 
See below for example. Default = none.<br>
<b>Note that the reference point should be within the range of elements 
given for the offsets to be taken into account.</b>

<li>FILE: Output file with aperture table. Default = none
</ul>
<p>

<b><u>Important note regarding emittances:</u></b>
<br>
The APERTURE module sets the actual emittance from the normalized values given as input using <br>
<tt>ex = exn / gamma</tt>, <br>
while the BEAM command in MAD-X uses the definition <br>
<tt>ex = exn / (4 * beta * gamma)</tt>
<p>

<h3>Not simply connex beam pipes</h3>
Methodically, the algorithm for finding the largest possible halo is fairly simple. 
The distance from halo centre to the first apex (i = 0) in the halo is calculated (l_i), 
and the equation for a line going through these points is derived. 
This line is then compared with all lines making the pipe polygon to find 
their respective intersection coordinates. 
The distance h_i between halo centre and intersection are then divided by l_i, 
to find the maximal ratio of enlargement, as seen below. 
This procedure is then repeated for all apexes i in the halo polygon, 
and the smallest ratio  of all apexes is the maximal enlargement ratio 
for this halo to just touch the pipe at this particular longitudinal position.
<br>
<IMG SRC=notsimple0.jpg align=center width="420"><br>

There is one complication to this solution; 
polygons which are not simple connexes. 
(Geometrical definition of ``simply connex'': A figure in which 
any two points can be connected by a line segment, with all points 
on the segment inside the figure.) 
The figure below shows what happens when a beam pipe polygon is not a simple connex. 
The halo is expanded in such a way that it overlaps the external polygon 
in the area where the latter is dented inwards.<br>
<IMG SRC=notsimple1.jpg align=center width="420" height="420"><br>

To make the module able to treat all kinds of polygons, <I>notsimple</I> must be activated. 
With this option activated, apexes are strategically added to the halo polygon wherever 
the beam pipe polygon might have an inward dent. 
This is done by drawing a line from halo centre to each apex on the pipe polygon. 
An apex with its coordinates on the intersection point line-halo is added to a table of halo polygon apexes. 
The result is that the halo polygon has a few ``excessive'' points on straight sections, 
but the algorithm used for expansion will now never miss a dent in the beam pipe. 
The use of the notsimple option significantly increases computation time.<br>

<h3>Trueprofile file syntax</h3>
This file contains magnet names, and their associated displacements of the axis for 
an arbitrary number of S, where So is the start of the magnet and Sn the end. 
The interval between each S must be regular, and X and Y 
must be given in meters. The magnet name must be identical to how it appears in the 
sequence. The displacements are only valid for this particular magnet, and cannot be 
assigned to a family of magnets. 
n1 is calculated for a number of slices determinated by the number of Si.

<h3>OFFSETELEM file syntax</h3>
This file contains parameters describing how certain elements are actually located in space 
with respect to a given reference element in the machine. 
<br>
The basis for this file is a pair of coordinate systems, {s,x} and {s,y} 
with the origin at the reference point. The units for s, x and y are meters. <br>
The actual location of the magnetic axis of a given element can be described, in each plane, as 
a parabola defined with three coefficients:
<pre>X_act(s) = DDX_OFF * s^2  +  DX_OFF * s  +  X_OFF</pre> and 
<pre>Y_act(s) = DDY_OFF * s^2  +  DY_OFF * s  +  Y_OFF</pre> 
<br>
The reference position for the element, X_ref(s) and Y_ref(s), is calculated 
by MAD-X via an internal call to the <a href="../survey/survey.html">SURVEY</a> 
module, taking the reference element as the origin. 
<p>
The resulting offset, in each plane, which is taken into account in the aperture calculation, 
is the difference between reference position and actual position: 
<pre>X_offset(s) = X_ref(s) - X_act(s)</pre> and 
<pre>Y_offset(s) = Y_ref(s) - Y_act(s)</pre> 
<p>
The offsets are only calculated for elements for which actual positions 
have been given through the OFFSETELEM file mechanism. 
<p>
The file must be given in TFS format according to the following template, 
with mandatory header and any number of data lines, one per element. 

<pre>
@ NAME             %06s "OFFSET" 
@ TYPE             %06s "OFFSET" 
@ REFERENCE        %10s "reference-element-name" 
* NAME          S_IP       X_OFF     DX_OFF    DDX_OFF    Y_OFF    DY_OFF     DDY_OFF
$ %s            %le        %le       %le       %le        %le      %le        %le
"elementname"	real       real      real      real       real     real       real
</pre>

<p>
Note that the column S_IP is actually not used, and the values are ignored, 
but the column and values are parsed nevertheless and must be present. 
The absence of this column will trigger an error. 
<p>

<b>Example:</b>
<pre>
@ NAME             %06s "OFFSET" 
@ TYPE             %06s "OFFSET" 
@ REFERENCE        %10s "mq.12r1.b1" 
* NAME          S_IP       X_OFF     DX_OFF    DDX_OFF    Y_OFF    DY_OFF     DDY_OFF
$ %s            %le        %le       %le       %le        %le      %le        %le

does not coincide with the reference trajectory.<p>

<h2>Aperture command example</h2>
</center>
<p>
The aperture module needs a Twiss table to operate on. It is important 
not to USE another period or sequence between the Twiss and aperture 
module calls, else aperture looses its table. One can choose the ranges 
for Twiss and aperture freely, they need not be the same.
<p>
<pre>
Use, period=lhcb1;
Select, flag=twiss, range=mb.a14r1.b1/mb.a17r1.b1, column=keyword,name,parent,k0l,k1l,s,betx,bety,n1;
Twiss, file=twiss.b1.data, betx=beta.ip1, bety=beta.ip1, x=+x.ip1, y=+y.ip1, py=+py.ip1;
Plot, haxis=s, vaxis=betx,bety, colour=100;

Select, flag=aperture, column=name,n1,x,dy;
Aperture, range=mb.b14r1.b1/mb.a17r1.b1, spec=5.235;
Plot, table=aperture, noline,v min=0, vmax=10, haxis=s, vaxis=n1, spec, on_elem, style=100;
</pre>
<p>
The <a href="../Introduction/select.html">select</a> command can be 
used to choose which columns to print in the output file. 
<br>
Column names:
name, n1, n1x_m, n1y_m, apertype,
aper_1, aper_2, aper_3, aper_4,
rtol, xtol, ytol,
s, betx, bety, dx, dy, x, y,
on_ap, on_elem, spec
<p>
n1 is the maximum beam size in sigma, while n1x_m and n1y_m is the n1 values in SI units 
in the x- and y-direction.
<p>
aper_# means for all apertypes but racetrack:<br>
aper_1 = half width rectangle<br>
aper_2 = half heigth rectangle<br>
aper_3 = horizontal semi-axis ellipse (or radius if circle)<br>
aper_4 = vertical semi-axis ellipse<p>
For racetrack, the aperture parameters will have the same meaning as the tolerances:<br>
aper_1 and xtol = horizontal displacement of radial part <br>
aper_2 and ytol = vertical displacement of radial part <br>
aper_3 and rtol = radius <br>
aper_4 = not used
<p>
On_elem indicates whether the node is an element or a drift, and on_ap 
whether it has a valid aperture. The Twiss parameters are the interpolated 
values used for aperture computation.
<p>
When one wants to plot the aperture, the table=aperture parameter is 
necessary. The normal line of hardware symbols along the top is not 
compatible with the aperture table, so it is best to include 
noline. Plot instead the column on_elem along the vaxis to have a 
simple picture of the hardware. Spec can be used for giving a limit 
value for n1, to have something to compare with on the plot. This example 
provides a plot,
<p>
<IMG SRC=aperexample.jpg align=center width="740" height="620">
<p>
where we see the n1, beta functions and the hardware symbolized by on_elem.
