<h2>MAD-X Module Writer's Guide</h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
MAD-X, in its actual form, consists of a main program in Fortran-77 that 
does nothing but call a C program which handles the overall control. 
This C program (CONTROL in the following)
in turn calls modules written in Fortran-77, possibly 
Fortran-90 or Fortran-95, and C. The Fortran-77 modules come from MAD-8
and are adapted to the new structure.
<p>
All I/O (except for debug or error messages) is performed by CONTROL. The
modules receive their input data via calls (Fortran), or take them from
structures (C); the module outputs are stored in tables or variables via
calls (Fortran) or directly in structures (C).
<p>
For each new module to be added, FS will provide a complete
development environment consisting of:
<ul>
<li>Makefile</li>
<li>A separate mad-X version with a call to the new module</li>
<li>Access to the input commands steering the module</li>
</ul>
Additional functionality will be added to CONTROL as it becomes necessary,
i.e. to gain access to data not yet provided.
<p>
In the following, the different cases are handled separately.
<ul>
<h2>C part</h2>
The C language is already pretty safe by nature. However, one can
still produce bad code! Therefore, use the compile flags "-Wall
-pedantic" (can be done via "make -f Makefile_develop" either for madx
or madxp) and please fix all warnings that the compiler detects. The
last checking campaign revealed hundreds of warnings!
To allow for better code maintainability we have recently to introduce
a general indentation by 2 characters per level
level with all curly brackets on an extra line. The curly brackets are
aligned with the operators. FS has semi-automatic tools to do this
indentation.
<li> Memory allocation: <font color=ff0000>Never use the plain
malloc or calloc C functions!</font>. Instead use the wrappers <font
color=ff0000> mymalloc and mycalloc </font>. The syntax of how to call
these functions can be found in madxu.c.
<h2>Fortran</h2>
Fortran normally mixes well with C (at least under Unix) provided a few
<a href="fortran-rules.html">basic rules</a> are respected.
They concern mainly the transfer of arguments to and from C.
<p>
Normally the module will already exist in MAD-8.In this case, follow these
steps:
<ul>
<li>Extract all routines belonging to the module from MAD-8 (possibly
with the help of FS)
<li>Find out which routines if any have already been transmitted to mad-X
<li>Remove all common statements
<li>Transfer variables that exist only inside the module either via calls
(as arguments), or via a common block with a name reminding of the module.
This common block has to be identical in all routines where it appears.
<li>Make a list of all variables that the module needs from outside
<li>Give the list to FS so he can provide them
<li>Make a list of the output data provided by the module (reminder:
the module should only print error messages, 
and transfer all result data to tables or variables);
Discuss the details of the output storage with FS
<li>Attach the modified module to mad-X and test it
<li>Provide module documentation (based on MAD-8 documentation)
<li>Provide test jobs that test the module abilities as far as reasonable
</ul>
If it is a new module, the above rules are modified accordingly. However,
new modules should be written in C whenever possible.
<p>
<h2>Strict Checking</h2>
Before committing to CVS (see next section) it is mandatory
to perform a strict check of all your examples. To this end create an
executable with Makefile_develop:
<p>
<ul>
<li> For madx perform: "make -f Makefile_develop"
<li> For madxp perform: "make -f Makefile_develop madxp"
</ul>
Check compiler output for warnings and get rid of them. Then run your
examples with these executables until MAD-X finishes the job
successfully. There will be a crash if variables have not been
initialized before usage and in case of out-of-bound usage of arrays.
<p>
<h2>CVS</h2>
MAD-X is kept under CVS (Concurrent Version System). The CVS version
number should be >=1.11.2.
<p>
Here are the  CVS basics for MAD-X:
<p>
<ul>
<li> For CERN users: First step is to include the following lines into
your .tcshrc file in your HOME directory (users of other SHELLs adapt
accordingly):
<ul>
<p>
setenv CVSROOT :kserver:isscvs.cern.ch:/local/reps/madx
<p>
setenv CVSEDITOR emacs
</ul>
(second command for emacs users) use "source .tcshrc" to activate the
MAD-X CVS repository.
<li> Go to your directory of choice, probably the one where you develop
your module.
<li> type <font color=ff0000>cvs checkout madX</font> this will create
a new directory named <font color=00ff00>madX</font> with the newest
files from the CVS repository. Change directory to <font
color=00ff00>madX</font>.
<li> Make your changes.
<li> <font color=ff0000>VERY IMPORTANT BEFORE PROCEEDING!!! </font>
<ul>
<li> Before you <font color=ff0000>commit</font> your changes check
with <font color=ff0000>cvs log</font> <font
color=0000ff>your_file</font> if anybody has worked on that file in
the meantime.
<li> Also, before a <font color=ff0000>commit</font> please check
with <font color=ff0000>cvs -n update -A </font> <font
color=0000ff>your_file</font> if this is truly what you want to commit
or if there are conflicts. Explanation: <font color=ff0000>-n</font>
is a global CVS option that give information without actually changing
any files, the auxiliary <font color=ff0000>-A</font> flag removes
<font color=ff0000>sticky tags</font> about which you do not really
want to know about!
<li> With <font color=ff0000>make</font> produce an executable <font
color=0000ff>madx</font> and check that all your examples run
properly!
</ul>
<li> type <font color=ff0000>cvs commit </font> <font
color=0000ff>your_file</font> for each file you have changed. 
<li> In the rare case that there is a conflict with another module writer
that has edited the same file, you have to contact him to sort out
possible problems. It is one of the advantage of the CVS system to
detect these conflicts.
<li> Optional: Go back to directory above and type <font
color=ff0000>cvs release madX </font> this insures that you really
have committed all changed files before getting rid of the <font
color=00ff00>madX</font> directory.
<li> Optional: If you want to know about the history of a file type
<font color=ff0000>cvs log -S</font> <font
color=0000ff>your_file</font> (you have to be in the <font
color=00ff00>madX</font> directory). Explanation: The <font
color=ff0000>-S</font> flags avoids excessive printout.  
</ul>
