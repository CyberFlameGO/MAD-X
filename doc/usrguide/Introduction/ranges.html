<h2>Range and Class Selection Format</h2>
</center>
<p>
<ul>
<li><a name=range>RANGE</a>:
A range can be defined starting at 
a given element and ending at another element, both elements included.
Two forms exist:
<pre>
range=<a name=position>position</a>;
range=position1/position2;
</pre>
In the first case, only one element is selected; in the second case, one
or several elements are selected. NOTE: position1 must not be behind
position2 in the sequence.
<p>
"position" is composed of the element name and an optional occurrence
count in the sequence:
<pre>
mq.ir5.l6..1          ! no occurrence count given
mb[17]                ! occurrence count given
</pre>
There are two predefined MAD indices:
<ul>
<li><a name=s>#S</a>.
The start of the beam line expanded by USE,
<li><a name=e>#E</a>.
The end of the beam line expanded by USE.
</ul>
If, in the USE statement, only a range is selected:
<pre>
use,period=lhcb1,range=ir1/ir5;
</pre>
then "#s" and "#e" refer to the start and end of the expanded range,
of course.
<p>
Examples for ranges:
<pre>
..,range=#s;           ! first element
..,range=#s/#e;        ! full expansion range
..,range=mb[5]/#e;     ! from mb 5 to end
..,range=mq.ir5.l6..1; ! first occurrence of element mq.ir5.l6..1
</pre>

<li><a name=class>CLASS</a>:
The single name of a class (no occurrence counts). A class is the name
of an element (or basic type) from which other elements have been derived.
Example:
<pre>
mq:quadrupole;
q1:mq;
q2:mq;
q1..a:q1;
q2..b:q2;
</pre>
makes classes from mq, q1, and q2. Selection class="mq" will actually select
q1, q2, q1..a, and q2..b in the above example.
