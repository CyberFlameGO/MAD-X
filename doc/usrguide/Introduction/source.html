<h2>Source and binaries</h2>

<p>
<!The latest source of MAD-X can be found in this <a href="../src">
The latest source of MAD-X can be found in this <a href="http://www.cern.ch/Frank.Schmidt/mad-X_src">
source directory</a>.

The .tgz file in there contains all the other files in the directory.
You find two history files one covering the changes between the latest
2 versions and the other gives the full project history up to and including the latest version <h5> madX_full_project.history.</h5>
The make files Makefile, Makefile_g95 and Makefile_nag work on Linux
machines and the MAC given the corresponding compiler is available,
lf95, g95 and nag respectively. There is a Makefile.bat for Windows
which requires lf95. Then there also Makefile_develop and
Makefile.prof for compiling on Linux with special strict flags and for
profiling respectively.
It is also convenient to go to CERN's <a
href="http://svnweb.cern.ch/world/wsvn/madx/trunk/madX/#path_trunk_madX_">SVN
page for MAD-X (world-wide READ access)</a>.
<p>
Besides the regular MAD-X versions there are also intermediate one:
the source code of the latest released version (SVN version might be
newer) can be found at <a
href="http://www.cern.ch/Frank.Schmidt/mad-X_newest_src">latest
released version source directory</a>, while the latest Linux binaries
of MAD-X (madx (PTC always included!)) can be found in the <a
href="http://www.cern.ch/Frank.Schmidt/mad-X_bin"> Linux binary
directory</a>.

<p><font color="#ff0000">At the same place (courtesy
Yngve.Inntjore.Levinsen@cern.ch) you will find a RPM of the latest
version convenient for MAD-X installation on REDHAT like LINUX
distributions. A DEB package can be provided if somebody volunteers to
test it.</font></p>


For Windows you find the executables at the
