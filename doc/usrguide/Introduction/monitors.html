<h2>Beam Position Monitors</h2>
</center>

A beam monitor has no specific effect on the beam and behaves like a drift space.
In addition it serves to record the beam position for closed orbit
correction.
<p>
Three different types of beam position monitors are recognised:
<ul>
<li><a name=hmon>HMONITOR</a>.
Monitor for the horizontal beam position,
<li><a name=vmon>VMONITOR</a>.
Monitor for the vertical beam position,
<li><a name=mon>MONITOR</a>.
Monitor for both horizontal and vertical beam position.
</ul>
<pre>
label: HMONITOR,    L=real;
label: VMONITOR,    L=real;
label: MONITOR,     L=real;
</pre>
A beam position monitor has one real attribute:
<ul>
<li>L:
The length of the monitor (default: 0 m). 
<!-- If the length is different from zero, -->
<!-- the beam position is recorded in the centre of the monitor. -->
</ul>
Examples:
<pre>
MH: HMONITOR,L=1;
MV: VMONITOR;
</pre>
The <a href="local_system.html#straight">straight reference system</a>
for a monitor is a cartesian coordinate system.

<h2>Instruments</h2>
</center>

An instrument has no specific effect on the beam and behaves like a drift space.
Instruments are different from beam position monitors and are not used for closed orbit correction.
<p>
Two different types of instruments are recognised:
<ul>
<li><a name=inst>INSTRUMENT</a>.
A place holder for any type of beam instrumentation.
Optically it behaves like a drift space;
it returns <em>no beam observation</em>.
It represent a class of elements
which is completely independent from drifts and monitors.
<li><a name=plac>PLACEHOLDER</a>
A place holder for any type of element. 
Internally it is equivalent to an INSTRUMENT: optically it behaves as a drift space, 
it returns <em>no beam observation</em>. It represent a class of elements 
which is completely independent from drifts and monitors.
</ul>
<pre>
label: INSTRUMENT,  L=real;
label: PLACEHOLDER, L=real;
</pre>
An instrument has one real attribute:
<ul>
<li>L:
The length of the instrument (default: 0 m). 
</ul>
The <a href="local_system.html#straight">straight reference system</a>
for an instrument is a cartesian coordinate system.
