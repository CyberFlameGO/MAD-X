<h1>MATRIX: Arbitrary Element</h1>

<pre>label: MATRIX,TYPE=name,L=real,KICK1=real,...,KICK6=real,
               RM11=real,...,RM66=real,
               TM111=real,...,TM666=real;
</pre>
The MATRIX permits the definition of an arbitrary transfer matrix.
It has four real array attributes:
<ul>
<li>L:
Length of the element, which may be zero.
<li>KICKi:
Defines the kick of the element acting on the six phase space coordinates.
</li><li>RMik:
Defines the linear transfer matrix (6*6) of the element.
</li><li>TMikl:
Defines the second-order terms (6*6*6) of the element.
</li></ul>
Data values not entered are taken from the identity transformation,
kick and second order terms are zero as default. In the thin-lens
tracking module the length of an arbitrary matrix is accepted, however
no second order are allowed to avoid non symplectic tracking runs. In
the latter case the tracking run will be aborted.
