<H2>Dipedge Element</H2>
</center>
<p>
A thin element describing the edge focusing of a dipole has been 
introduced in order to make it possible to track trajectories in the 
presence of dipoles with pole face angles. Only linear terms are
considered since the higher order terms would the tracking
non-symplectic. The transformation of the machine elements into thin
lenses leaves dipedge untouched and splits correctly the SBENDS's.
<p>
It does not make sense to use it alone. It can be specified at the 
entrance and the exit of a SBEND.

They are defined by the commands:
<PRE>
label : dipedge, h=real, e1=real, fint=real, hgap=real, tilt=real;
</PRE>
It has zero length and five attributes.
<UL>
<LI>H:
Is angle/length or 1/rho (default: 0 m<sup>-1</sup> - for the default
the dipedge element has no effect).
(must be equal to that of the associated SBEND)
<LI>E1:
The rotation angle for the pole face.The sign convention
is as for a SBEND <a href="bend.html">Bending Magnet</a>. Note that it
is different for an entrance and an exit.
(default: 0 rad).
<LI>FINT: field integral as for SBEND
<a href="local_system.html#sbend">sector bend</a>. Note that each dipedge
has its own fint, so fintx is no longer necessary.
<LI>HGAP: half gap height of the associated SBEND
<a href="bend.html">Bending Magnet</a>. 
<p><LI>TILT:
The roll angle about the longitudinal axis (default: 0 rad,
i.e. a horizontal bend). A positive angle represents a clockwise
rotation.
</UL>
