<H2>Effect of the bv flag in MAD-X</H2>
</center>
<p>
<h4></b>
When reversing the direction ("V") of a particle in a magnetic field ("B")
while keeping its charge constant, the resulting force V * B changes sign.
This is equivalent to flipping the field, but not the direction.
<p>
For practical reasons the properties of all elements of the LHC are defined in the MADX input as if
they apply to a clockwise proton beam ("LHC beam 1"). This allows a single definition for elements
traversed by both beams. Their effects on a beam with identical particle charge but running in the
opposite direction ("LHC beam 2") must then be reversed inside the program.
<p>
In MADX this may be taken into account by setting the value of the <b>BV</b> attribute in the
<b>Beam</b> commands. In the case of LHC beam 1 <b>(clockwise)</b> and beam 2 <b>(counter-clockwise)</b>,
treated in MADX both as clockwise proton beams, the Beam commands must look as follows:
<b><pre>
   Beam, sequence=lhcb1, particle=proton, pc=450, bv=+1;
   Beam, sequence=lhcb2, particle=proton, pc=450, bv=-1;
</pre></b>
