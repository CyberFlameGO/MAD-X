<dt>Twiss calculation is 4D only!</dt>
<p>
<dd>
    The Twiss command will calculate an approximate 6D closed orbit when
    the accelerator structure includes an active <a
    href="../Introduction/cavity.html">cavity</a>. However, the calculation
    of the Twiss parameters are 4D only. This may result in apparently
    non-closure of the beta values in the plane with non-zero
    dispersion. The full 6D Twiss parameters can be calculated with the <a
    href="../ptc_twiss/ptc_twiss.html">ptc_twiss</a> command. Presently, the <a
    href="../thintrack/thintrack.html">Thinlens Tracking</a> module
    suffers from this deficiency since it requires the true 6d closed
    orbit and not the approximate one as calculated by Twiss. In this
    context one has to mention that the coordinate system for the Twiss
    module is not x, px in the horizontal plane as the advertised
    canonical coordinates instead x, x' have been used (same for the
    vertical plane).
<p> 
    Mind you that for TWISS with the "CENTRE" attribute activated, i.e. looking
    inside the element, the closed orbit includes the misalignment of the element.

<dt>Dispersion for machines with small relativistic beta</dt>
<p>
<dd>
    The MAD-X uses the PT coordinate as the canonical momentum in the
    longitudinal plane. The derivative of e.g. dispersion is therefore not
    delta-p over p but PT. Therefore one unfortunately finds the
    dispersion being divided by the relativistic beta which is annoying
    for low energy machines. PTC allows to change the coordinate system to
    delta-p over p with the "time=false" option of the <a
    href="../ptc_general/ptc_general.html#PTC_CREATE_LAYOUT">PTC_CREATE_LAYOUT</a>
    command which delivers the proper dispersion with the <a
    href="../ptc_twiss/ptc_twiss.html">ptc_twiss</a> command.

<dt>Non-standard definition of DDX, DDPX, DDY, DDPY</dt>
<p>
<dd>
    The MAD-X proper defintion of DDX, DDPX, DDY, DDPY is not the
    second order derivative with respect to deltap/p but multiplied by
    a factor of 2. The corresponding values from ptc_normal and in
    ptc_twiss are the proper derivaties to all orders.

<dt>Chromaticity calculation in presence of coupling</dt>
<p>
<dd>
    Chromaticity calculations are typically in order and agree with
    PTC and other codes. However, it was recently discovered that in
    presences of coupling MAD-X simply seems to ignore coupling when
    the chromaticity is calculated. This is surprising since the
    eigentunes Q1, Q2 are properly calculated for a given (small!)
    dp/p. The issue is under investigation.

<dt>Field errors in thick elements</dt>
<p>
<dd>
         Only a very limited number of field error components are
         considered in TWISS calculations for some thick
         elements. Find below a complete list of all those field error 
         components that are taking into account for a particular
         thick element. It should be mentioned that BENDs also allow a
         skew quadrupole component k1s but NOT in the body of the
         magnet. It is only active in the edge effect for radiation
         (expert use only).<p>

<dt>MAD-X versus PTC</dt>
<p>
<dd>
    The user has to understand that PTC exists inside of MAD-X as a
    library. MAD-X offers the interface to PTC, i.e. the MAD-X input
    file is used as input for PTC. Internally, both PTC and MAD-X have
    their own independent databases which are linked via the
    interface. With the <a
    href="../ptc_general/ptc_general.html#PTC_CREATE_LAYOUT">PTC_CREATE_LAYOUT</a>
    command, only numerical numbers are transferred from the MAD-X
    database to the PTC database. Any modification to the MAD-X
    database is ignored in PTC until the next call to <a
    href="../ptc_general/ptc_general.html#PTC_CREATE_LAYOUT">PTC_CREATE_LAYOUT</a>.
    For example, a deferred expression of MAD-X after a <a
    href="../ptc_general/ptc_general.html#PTC_CREATE_LAYOUT">PTC_CREATE_LAYOUT</a>
    command is ignored within PTC.
<p>
When introducing a cavity with the "harmon" instead of the "freq"
attribute (highly discouraged!) a problem arises for ptc_twiss due
to the fact that internally "harmon" is transferred to "freq" too
late. A simple "twiss" command executed before PTC start-up will
help. However, avoiding "harmon" is advantageous.

<dt>SLOW attribute in matching</dt>
<p>
The "slow" attribute enforces the old matching procedure and is
considerably slower. Therefore we did not make it the default
option. Recently a number of parameters, like "RE56", have been added
to the list of matchable parameters in the default and fast
version. Nevertheless, some parameters are only available when using
the "slow" attribute. Therefore it is advisable to check with the
"slow" attribute if there are doubts about the matching procedure.
</div> 

<div> 
<dl>
<dt>Validity of Twiss parameters</dt>
<p>
The standard Teng-Edwards Twiss parameters suffer from a deficiency
near full coupling: i.e. the "donuts" of linear motion in x-x' and y-y'
phase space have no hole anymore. This means that all energy is
transfered from one plane to the other. In this case the Twiss
parameters and the coupling matrix (R11, R12, R21, R22) become large
or even infinite or the beta functions might become negative. The
Ripken-Mais Twiss parameters are always well defined (they are the
"average" amplitude functions of their proper phase space region),
i.e. at full coupling we have: beta11 ~ beta12 and beta21 ~
beta22. Using the "RIPKEN" flag Twiss calculates the Mais-Ripken
parameters via a transformation from the Teng-Edwards Twiss
parameters. Obviously this fails when the Teng-Edwards Twiss
parameters are ill defined. In this case one has to rely on
ptc_twiss.
