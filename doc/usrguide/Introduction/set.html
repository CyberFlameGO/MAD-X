<h2>Set Statements</h2>
</center>

<pre>
set,format="...", sequence="...";
</pre>
The set command allows 2 actions:
<h3>1) Format</h3>
The first command lets you vary the output precision.
<pre>
parameter: format = s1, s2, s3
</pre>
(up to) three strings defining the integer, floating, and string
output format for the save, show, value, and table output. The formats
can be given in any order and stay valid until replaced. The defaults
are:
<pre>
"10d","18.10g","-18s".
</pre>
They follow the C convention. The quotes are mandatory. The allowed
formats are:
<pre>
"nd" for integer with n = field width.
</pre>
<pre>
"m.nf" or "m.ng" or "m.ne" for floating, m field width, n precision.
</pre>
<pre>
"ns" for string output.
</pre>
The default is "right adjusted", a "-" changes it to "left adjusted".

Example:
<pre>
set,format="22.14e";
</pre>
changes the current floating point format to 22.14e; the other formats
remain untouched.
<pre>
set,format="s","d","g";
</pre>
sets all formats to automatic adjustment according to C conventions.
<h3>2) Sequence</h3>
The second command lets you choose the current sequence without having
to use the "USE" command, which would bring you back to a bare lattice
without errors. The command only works if the chosen sequence had been
activated before with the "USE" command, otherwise a warning will be
issued and MAD-X will continue with the unmodified current sequence.
This command is particularly useful for commands that do not have the
sequence as an argument like "EMIT" or "IBS".
