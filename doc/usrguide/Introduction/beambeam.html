<h2>BEAMBEAM: Beam-beam Interaction</h2>

The command BEAMBEAM may be inserted in a beam line
to simulate a beam-beam interaction point:
<pre>
label: BEAMBEAM, SIGX=real,SIGY=real,
                 XMA=real,YMA=real,CHARGE=real
                 BBSHAPE=int,WIDTH=real,BBDIR=int;
</pre>
The beam-beam interaction is represented by a
four-dimensional interaction with a thin element, i.e. horizontal
and vertical non-linear kicks.
The code for this element has been contributed by J.M. Veuillen 
(1987) and extended by S. Sorge (2007).
<ul>
<LI>SIGX:
The horizontal extent of the opposite beam (default: 1 m).
Meaning depends on parameter BBSHAPE.
<LI>SIGY:
The vertical extent of the opposite beam (default: 1 m).
Meaning depends on parameter BBSHAPE.
<LI>XMA:
The horizontal displacement of the opposite beam with respect to
the ideal orbit (default: 0 m).
<LI>YMA:
The vertical displacement of the opposite beam with respect to
the ideal orbit (default: 0 m).
<LI>CHARGE:
The charge of particles in the opposite beam in elementary charges. 
It is set by default CHARGE=1. So, if you want to describe collisions 
between beams containing the same particles having a charge different 
from 1, you have to set CHARGE explicitly in BEAM and 
in BEAMBEAM. 
<LI>BBSHAPE: The parameter to choose the radial density shape of the 
opposite beam (default: 1)
<ul>
<LI> BBSHAPE=1: Gaussian shape (default), SIGX/SIGY: standard deviation in 
vertical/horizontal direction.
<LI> BBSHAPE=2: <a href="beambeam_n_trapez.jpg">trapezoidal shape</a>, 
SIGX/SIGY: half width of density profile, 
i.e. distance from the centre to half edge region with linear decrease of 
density in horizontal/vertical direction. Still only circular opposite beam 
possible, i.e. in the calculations 
SIGX'=SIGY'=(SIGX+SIGY)/2 is used, if SIGX and SIGY have different values <br>
<a href="beambeam_n_trapez.jpg"><img src="beambeam_n_trapez.jpg" width="35%" border="0" alt="BBSHAPE=2, trapezoidal shape" /></a>

<LI> BBSHAPE=3: <a href="beambeam_n_hollowparabol.jpg">hollow-parabolic shape</a>, 
SIGX/SIGY: distance from the centre 
to the maximum of the parabolic density profile in vertical/horizontal 
direction. Still only circular opposite beam possible, 
i.e. in the calculations 
SIGX'=SIGY'=(SIGX+SIGY)/2 is used, if SIGX and SIGY have different values <br>
<a href="beambeam_n_hollowparabol.jpg"><img src="beambeam_n_hollowparabol.jpg" width="35%" border="0"  alt="BBSHAPE=3, hollow-parabolic shape" /></a>

</ul>
The restriction to circular opposite beams in the cases BBSHAPE=2,3 
appears to be sufficient, because such beam profiles are more important 
for the description of the interaction between the particle beam and 
an electron beam of an electron cooler, which are usually circular. 
<LI> WIDTH: The relative extent of the edge region, absolute value is given by 
WIDTH*SIGX and WIDTH*SIGY vertical and horizontal direction, respectively. 
For 
<ul>
<LI> BBSHAPE=1, WIDTH is meaningless and will be ignored.
<LI> BBSHAPE=2, WIDTH denotes the full width of the edge region in units of 
SIGX (or SIGX' and SIGY', respectively, if SIGX and SIGY are not equal), i.e. 
if WIDTH=0.01 and SIGX=5 mm, the edge 
region has a full width of 0.05 mm. It must be WIDTH < 2.0.
<LI> BBSHAPE=3, WIDTH denotes the full width at half maximum of the parabolic 
density profile in units of SIGX (or SIGX' and SIGY', respectively, if SIGX 
SIGY are not equal. It must be 
WIDTH < SQRT(2.0).
</ul>
<LI> BBDIR: The parameter to choose the direction of motion of the 
opposite beam relative to the beam considered. It determines 
the sign of the Lorenz force between the both beams (default: -1): 
<ul/>
<LI> BBDIR=-1: Beams move in the opposite direction as in a collider. 
Therefore, the Lorenz force enhances the beam-beam interaction. 
<LI> BBDIR=0: Opposite beam does not move, Lorenz force is neglected 
<LI> BBDIR=1: Beams move in the same direction as in an electron cooler. 
So, the Lorenz force reduces the beam-beam interaction. 
</ul>
Note: 
<ul/>
<LI> The particles in the beam considered may have a momentum deviation 
given by DELTAP defined in the TRACK command. 
<LI> The opposite beam is assumed to have the velocity according to the 
unperturbed energy o the particles in the beam considered. 
So, only the direction of motion can be chosen. 
<LI> In the case of motion in the opposite direction (BBDIR=-1), 
the time of interaction between the beams is given by 
tau = length/(2*beta*c_light), where length is the length of a bunch in the 
opposite beam. In the case of motion in the same direction 
(BBDIR=1) as in an electron cooler, this time 
is given by tau = length/(beta*c_light), where length is the length of 
the cooler. So, the factor 1/2 is inserted only for BBDIR=-1 to calculate 
correct results. 
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
A beam-beam element requires the particle energy
(<a href="beam.html#energy">ENERGY</a>)
and the particle charge
(<a href="beam.html#charge">CHARGE</a>)
as well as the number of particles per bunch 
(<a href="beam.html#npart">NPART</a>)
to be set by a <a href="beam.html">BEAM</a> command
before any calculations are performed.
