\section{Constraints}

In matching it is desired to specify equality constraints, as well as
lower and upper limits for a quantity. MAD accepts the following forms
of constraints:  

\begin{verbatim}

! equality constraint:
name=expression

! upper limit:
name<expression

! lower limit:
name>expression

! both upper and lower limit for the same name:
name<expression,name>expression
\end{verbatim}
