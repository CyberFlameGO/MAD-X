<h2>Beam Line Sequences</h2>
</center>

MAD-X accepts two forms of an accelerator definition: sequences and
<a href="line.html">lines</a>. However, the sequence definition is the
only one used internally; lines are converted into sequences when they
are USEd. Consequently, only sequences can be saved (written onto a file)
by MAD-X.
<p>
The corresponding sequence of statements defining a sequence is
<pre>
name: SEQUENCE,REFER=keyword,REFPOS=name,LENGTH=real,ADD_PASS=integer,NEXT_SEQU='seq_name'
label: class,AT=real{,attributes} | class,AT=real | sequ_name, AT=real
    ...
ENDSEQUENCE
</pre>
where "real" means a real number, variable, or expression.
<p>
The first line gives the sequence name, a REFER flag (entry, centre,
or exit) which specifies at which part of the element its position along
the beam line will be given (default: centre), a REFPOS argument used
for sequence insertion, and the total length.
The ADD_PASS=integer option specifies a number of additionnal passes (max. 5)
through the structure; in case of an RBEND the angle will be overwritten in
 survey using the i-th component (1 <= i <= <tt>add_pass</tt> <= 5) of its <i>array_of_angles</i>
(see <a href="bend.html">RBEND<a>).
The NEXT_SEQU='seq_name' concatenates the sequence with name 'seq_name'
 to the end of the specified sequence.
<p>
Inside the sequence ... endsequence bracket three types of commands
may be placed:
<ul>
<li>an element declaration as usual, with an additional "at" attribute
giving the element position relative to the start of the sequence;
CAUTION: an existing definition for an element with the same name will
be replaced, however, defining the same element twice inside the same
sequence results in a fatal error, since a unique object (this element)
would be placed at two different positions.</li>
<li>a class name with a position; this causes an instance of the class
to be placed at the position given. For uses inside ranges, instances
of the same class can be accessed with an occurrence count.</li>
<li>a sequence name with a position; this causes the sequence with that
name to be placed at the position indicated. The entry, centre, or exit
of the inserted sequence are placed at the position given, UNLESS a "refpos"
(the name of an element in the inserted sequence) is given, in which case
the sequence is inserted such that the refpos element is 
at the insertion point.</li>
</ul>
<!-- When the sequence is expanded in a  -->
<!-- <a href="../control/general.html#use">USE</a> command, -->
<!-- MAD generates the missing drift spaces. At this moment, overlapping elements -->
<!-- will cause "negative drift length" errors. -->
When the sequence is expanded in a
<a href="../control/general.html#use">USE</a> command, 
MAD-X generates the missing drift spaces according to the following rules:
<ul>
<li>When the distance between the exit of the previous element and the entrance 
of the next element is positive and greater than a threshold of one micrometer 
an explicit drit is generated with its own name, unless an already existing 
drift space with the same length (within 10**(-12)m tolerance) can be 
re-used.</li> 
<li>When the absolute value of the distance between the exit of the previous 
element and the entrance of the next element is less than a given tolerance 
of one micrometer, no drift space is created and the elements are considered 
as contiguous.
<br><b> Note that in very specific cases this can cause very small errors to 
accumulate and the actual length of the sequence can vary slightly 
from the declared length. (see second example below)</b></li> 
<li>When the distance between the exit of the previous element and the entrance 
of the next element is negative and less than minus one micrometer, the elements 
are considered to be overlapping and MAD-X terminates with a ``negative drift 
length'' fatal error.</li> 
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note that a bug in the expansion of sub-sequences within a sequence was reported 
in July 2013 and fixed from version 5.01.03 onwards. 
Details are explained <a href="./sequence_bug.html">here.</a></b>
<p>
For efficiency reasons MAD-X imposes an <b>important restriction</b>
on element lengths and positions: once a sequence is expanded, the element
positions and lengths are considered as fixed; in order to vary a position
or element length, a re-expansion of the sequence becomes necessary.
The MATCH command contains a special flag "vlength" to
<a href="../match/match.html">match element lengths</a>.
<p>
<a name=example>Example:</a>
<pre>
! define a default beam (otherwise fatal error)
beam;
! Define element classes for a simple cell:
b:     sbend,l=35.09, angle = 0.011306116;
qf:    quadrupole,l=1.6,k1=-0.02268553;
qd:    quadrupole,l=1.6,k1=0.022683642;
sf:    sextupole,l=0.4,k2=-0.13129;
sd:    sextupole,l=0.76,k2=0.26328;
! define the cell as a sequence:
sequ:  sequence,l=79;
   b1:    b,      at=19.115;
   sf1:   sf,     at=37.42;
   qf1:   qf,     at=38.70;
   b2:    b,      at=58.255,angle=b1->angle;
   sd1:   sd,     at=76.74;
   qd1:   qd,     at=78.20;
   endm:  marker, at=79.0;
endsequence;
</pre>
<br><br>
Example of very small drift space being ignored during sequence
expansion: 
<pre>
QTEST: QUADRUPOLE, L=1.000001;
 
TEST: SEQUENCE, REFER=centre, L=2.;
  QTEST, AT=1.5;	 
ENDSEQUENCE;	 

USE, SEQUENCE=TEST;
SURVEY, FILE='test';
</pre>
The above sequence will expand to a total length of 2.0000005 m, half
a micron longer than the claimed length of 2 m, but will not fail.
