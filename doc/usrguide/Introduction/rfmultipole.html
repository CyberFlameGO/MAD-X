    <h2>RFMULTIPOLE: Thin Radio-Frequency Multipole</h2>
    <div class="plaintext">
      <pre>Label:  RFMULTIPOLE, VOLT=real, LAG=real,
  HARMON=integer, FREQ=real,
  LRAD=real, TILT=real,
  KNL:={k0nl, k1nl, k2nl, ... },  ! Normal coefficients

    <div class="plaintext"> A RFMULTIPOLE is a thin-lens element which
      exhibits the properties of an RF-cavity and of a magnet of
      arbitrary order oscillating the a certain frequency:
      <p> </p>
      <ul>
        <li>L: The length of the rfmultipole (DEFAULT: 0 m) </li>
        <li>LAG: The phase lag [2pi] (DEFAULT: 0) </li>
        <li>FREQ: The frequency [MHz] (no DEFAULT). Note that if the RF
          frequency is not given, it is computed from the harmonic
          number and the revolution frequency f0 as before. However, for
          accelerating structures this makes no sense, and the frequency
          is mandatory. </li>
        <li>HARMON: The harmonic number h (no DEFAULT). Only if the
          frequency is not given. </li>
        <li>LRAD: A fictitious length, which was originally just used to
          compute synchrotron radiation effects. A non-zero LRAD in
          conjunction with the OPTION thin_foc set to a true logical
          value takes into account of the weak focussing of bending
          magnets. </li>
        <li>TILT: The roll angle about the longitudinal axis (default: 0
          rad). A positive angle represents a clockwise rotation of the
          multipole element.
          <p><b>Please note that contrary to MAD8 one has to specify the
              desired TILT angle, otherwise it is taken as 0 rad. We
              believe that the MAD8 concept of having individual TILT
              values for each component and on top with default values
              led to considerable confusion and allowed for excessive
              and unphysical freedom. Instead, in MAD-X the KNL/KSL
              components can be considered as the normal or skew
              multipole components of the magnet on the bench, while the
              TILT attribute can be considered as an tilt alignment
              error in the machine.</b> </p>
        </li>
        <li>KNL: The normal rfmultipole coefficients from order zero to
          the maximum; the parameters are positional, therefore zeros
          must be filled in for components that do not exist. Example of
          a thin-lens sextupole: ms:rfmultipole, knl:={0, 0, k2l}; </li>
        <li>KSL: The skew rfmultipole coefficients from order zero to
          the maximum; the parameters are positional, therefore zeros
          must be filled in for components that do not exist. Example of
          a thin-lens skew octupole:
          <p> </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <pre>	ms: rfmultipole, ksl:={0, 0, 0, k3sl};</pre>
      <blockquote>Both KNL and KSL may be specified for the same
        multipole. </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>VOLT: The peak RF voltage (DEFAULT: 0 MV). The effect of the
          cavity is </li>
        <li>delta(E) = VOLT * sin(2 pi * (LAG - HARMON * f0 t)). </li>
        <li>PNL: The phase for each normal rfmultipole coefficients from
          order zero to the maximum; the parameters are positional,
          therefore zeros must be filled in for components that do not
          exist. </li>
        <li>PSL: The phase for each skew rfmultipole coefficients from
          order zero to the maximum; the parameters are positional,
          therefore zeros must be filled in for components that do not
          exist. </li>
      </ul>
      A rfmultipole requires the particle energy (ENERGY) and the
      particle charge (CHARGE) to be set by a BEAM command before any
      calculations are performed. Notice that, contrary to the regular
      multipole where the dipole component has no effect on the
      reference orbit, an RF-Multipole that includes a dipole component
      bends also the reference orbit.
