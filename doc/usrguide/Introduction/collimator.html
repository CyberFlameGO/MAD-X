<h2>Collimators</h2>
</center>

The definition of collimators in MAD-X has been inherited from MAD8 and two types of collimators are defined:
<ul>
<li><a name=ecol>ECOLLIMATOR</a>.
<li><a name=rcol>RCOLLIMATOR</a>.
</ul>

Note that although two types are defined, both behave in exactly the same way within MAD-X and the type name does NOT imply elliptic or rectangular aperture. 

<pre>
label: ECOLLIMATOR,TYPE=name,L=real,XSIZE=real,YSIZE=real;
label: RCOLLIMATOR,TYPE=name,L=real,XSIZE=real,YSIZE=real;
</pre>

Either type has several real attributes:
<ul>
<li>L:
The collimator length (default: 0 m).
<li>XSIZE:
The horizontal half-aperture (default: unlimited). <b>OBSOLETE : Will be parsed but not used.</b>
<li>YSIZE:
The vertical half-aperture (default: unlimited). <b>OBSOLETE : Will be parsed but not used.</b>
</ul>

The actual definition of the aperture type and aperture parameters must be done in accordance with <a href="aperture.html">Defining aperture in MAD-X</a>.

<P>
Optically a collimator behaves like a drift space. 
However during tracking the aperture is checked at the entrance of the collimator, provided that the aperture type is one of the predefined RECTANGLE, ELLIPSE, RECTELLIPSE or LHCSCREEN types. 
In particular an aperture model defined in an external file will not be used during tracking.
<P>
If the length is not zero, the aperture is also checked at the exit. <b> TO BE CHECKED </b>
<P>
Example:
<pre>
COLLIM: ECOLLIMATOR,L=0.5,APERTYPE=ELLIPSE,APERTURE={0.01,0.005};
</pre>

The <a href="local_system.html#straight">straight reference system</a>
for a collimator is a cartesian coordinate system.
<P>
<b>NOTE:</b> When a collimator is displaced transversally in order to model 
an asymmetric collimator, particle losses in tracking are reported with
respect to the <b>displaced</b> reference system, not with respect to the
surrounding beam line.
