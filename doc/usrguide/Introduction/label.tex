\section{Identifiers or Labels}
\label{sec:label}

A label begins with a letter, followed by up to fifteen letters, digits,
decimal points (.), or underscores (\_). Characters beyond the sixteenth
are dropped, but should be avoided, and the resulting sequence must be
unique. 

A label may refer to a keyword, an element, a beam-line, a sequence,
etc.   The MAD-X keywords are protected; using one of them as a label
results in a fatal error.
