\subsection{Identifiers or Labels}
%%\end{center} 
  A label begins with a letter, followed by up to fifteen letters, digits, decimal points (.), or underscores (\_). Characters beyond the sixteenth are dropped, but should be avoided, and the resulting sequence must be unique. 

  A label may refer to a keyword, an element, a beam-line, a sequence, etc.   The MAD-X keywords are protected; using one of them as a label results in a fatal error.
