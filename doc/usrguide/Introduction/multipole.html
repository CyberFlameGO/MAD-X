<h2>MULTIPOLE: General Thin Multipole</h2>

<pre>
label:   MULTIPOLE,LRAD=real,TILT=real,
         KNL:={..,..,..}, KSL:={..,..,..};
</pre>
A MULTIPOLE is a thin-lens magnet of arbitrary order, including a dipole:
<ul>
<li>LRAD:
A fictitious length, which was originally just used to compute synchrotron
radiation effects.<br> A non-zero <b><font color="#ff0000"> LRAD </b></font> in conjunction 
with the <a href="../control/general.html#option">OPTION</a>
<b><font color="#ff0000"> thin_foc </b></font> set to a <b><font color="#ff0000"> true </b></font> logical
value takes into account of the weak focussing of bending magnets.
<LI>TILT:
The roll angle about the longitudinal axis (default: 0 rad).
A positive angle represents a clockwise rotation of the multipole
element. 
<p><b><font color="#ff0000"> 
Please note that contrary to MAD8 one has to specify the desired TILT
angle, otherwise it is taken as 0 rad. We believe that the MAD8
concept of having individual TILT values for each component and on top
with default values led to considerable confusion and allowed for
excessive and unphysical freedom. Instead, in MAD-X the KNL/KSL
components can be considered as the normal or skew multipole
components of the magnet on the bench, while the TILT attribute can be
considered as an tilt alignment error in the machine.
</b></font>
<li>KNL:
The normal multipole coefficients from order zero to the maximum;
the parameters are positional, therefore zeros must be filled in
for components that do not exist. Example of a thin-lens sextupole:
<pre>
ms:multipole, knl:={0, 0, k2l};
</pre>
<li>KSL:
The skew multipole coefficients from order zero to the maximum;
the parameters are positional, therefore zeros must be filled in
for components that do not exist. Example of a thin-lens skew octupole:
<pre>
ms:multipole, ksl:={0, 0, 0, k3sl};
</pre>
</ul>
Both KNL and KSL may be specified for the same multipole.
<p>
A multipole with no dipole component has no effect on the reference
orbit,
i.e. the reference system at its exit is the same as at its entrance.
If it includes a dipole component,
it has the same effect on the reference orbit as a dipole
with zero length and deflection angle K0L, being the first component
of KNL above.
