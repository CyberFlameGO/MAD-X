<h2>RF Cavity</h2>

<pre>
label: RFCAVITY, L=real,VOLT=real,LAG=real,HARMON=integer,FREQ=real;
                  <!-- HARMON=integer, BETRF=real,PG=real,

An RFCAVITY has eight real attributes and one integer attribute:
<ul>
<li>L:
The length of the cavity (DEFAULT: 0 m)
<li>VOLT:
The peak RF voltage (DEFAULT: 0 MV).
The effect of the cavity is
<p>
delta(<i>E</i>) = VOLT * sin(2 pi * (LAG - HARMON * <i>f<sub>0</sub> t</i>)).
<p>
<li>LAG:
The phase lag [2pi] (DEFAULT: 0).
<li>FREQ:
The frequency [MHz] (no DEFAULT).
Note that if the RF frequency is not given, it is
computed from the harmonic number
and the revolution frequency <i>f<sub>0</sub></i> as before. However,
for accelerating structures this makes no sense, 
and the frequency is mandatory.
<li>HARMON:
The harmonic number <i>h</i> (no DEFAULT). Only if the frequency is not given.
<!-- <li>BETRF:
RF coupling factor (DEFAULT: 0).
<li>PG:
The RF power per cavity (DEFAULT: 0 MW).
<li>SHUNT:
The relative shunt impedance (DEFAULT: 0 MOhm/m).
<li>TFILL:
The filling time of the cavity T<sub>fill</sub>
(DEFAULT: 0 microseconds). -->
<li><font color=ff0000><i> Please take note, that the following
MAD8 attributes: BETRF, PG, SHUNT and TFILL are currently not
implemented in MAD-X!</i><
<li><i> Note as well that twiss is 4D only. As a consequence the TWISS
parameters in the plane of non-zero dispersion may not close as
expected. Therefore, it is best to perform TWISS in 4D only, i.e. with
cavities switched off. If 6D is needed one has to use the
<a href="../ptc_twiss/ptc_twiss.html">ptc_twiss</a> command.
</i></font>
</ul>

The RFCAVITY has attributes that will only become active in PTC:
<ul>
<li>n_bessel (DEFAULT: 0): <p>
Transverse focussing effects are typically ignored in the cavity in
MAD-X or even PTC. This effect is being calculated to order n_bessel,
with n_bessel=0 disregarding this effect and with a correct treatment
when n_bessel goes to infinty.
<li>no_cavity_totalpath (DEFAULT: no_cavity_totalpath=false):<p>
flag to choose if in a cavity the transit time factor is considered
(no_cavity_totalpath=false) or if the particle is kept on the crest of
RF voltage (no_cavity_totalpath=true).
</ul>

A cavity requires the particle energy
(<a href="beam.html#energy">ENERGY</a>)
and the particle charge
(<a href="beam.html#charge">CHARGE</a>)
to be set by a <a href="beam.html">BEAM</a> command
before any calculations are performed.
<p>
Example:
<pre>
BEAM,PARTICLE=ELECTRON,ENERGY=50.0;
CAVITY:   RFCAVITY,L=10.0,VOLT=150.0,LAG=0.0,HARMON=31320;
</pre>
The <a href="local_system.html#straight">straight reference system</a>
for a cavity is a cartesian coordinate system.
