<h1>The MAD-X Program, Version 2.11</h1> 
Hans Grote and Frank Schmidt

<hr>
MAD is a tool for charged-particle optics in
alternating-gradient accelerators and beam lines.
It can handle very large and very small accelerators
and solves various problems on such machines.
<p>
<b><font size="+1" color=ff0000>
This new version supersedes MAD-8 which has been 
frozen.</font></b>
<p>
The input format has been modified slightly, mainly in order
to make it safer, and to allow the introduction of new features (WHILE
loop, MACROs, and others).
<p>
The MAD-X framework should make it easy to add new features
in the form of program modules. A <a href="module_doc.html">
Module Writer's Guide</a> is available and contains guidelines and
examples.
The authors of MAD hope that such modules will also be contributed
and documented by others.
As required, the table of contents and the indices will be revised.
The contributions of other authors are acknowledged in the relevant
chapters.
<p>
Last but not least it is only fair to mention that a large part of the
documentation provided here is based on the MAD-8 documentation that
was originally written and published by F. C. Iselin.
