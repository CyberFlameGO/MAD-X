<h1>EPRINT: List Machine Imperfections</h1>

This command prints a table of errors assigned to elements.
The range for these elements has to be specified.
Field errors are printed as absolute errors,
because all relative errors are transformed to the corresponding
absolute error at definition time.
An error print is requested by the statement
<font COLOR="#ff0000">
<pre>
SELECT,FLAG=ERROR,RANGE=range,CLASS=name,PATTERN=string;
EPRINT;
</pre>
</font>
and elements are now selected by the <a href="../Introduction/select.html">SELECT</a> command.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A listing for ALL elements, i.e. not only the selected, can be obtained with
the command
<font COLOR="#ff0000">
<pre>
EPRINT,FULL=TRUE;
</pre>
</font>
In that case, the SELECT command has no effect.
