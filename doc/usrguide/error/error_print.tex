\section{EPRINT: List Machine Imperfections}  
\label{sec:eprint}
This command prints a table of errors assigned to elements. The range
for these elements has to be specified. Field errors are printed as
absolute errors, because all relative errors are transformed to the
corresponding absolute error at definition time. An error print is
requested by the statement  

\begin{verbatim}
SELECT, FLAG=ERROR, RANGE=range, CLASS=name, PATTERN=string;
EPRINT;
\end{verbatim}
and elements are now selected by the
\href{../Introduction/select.html}{SELECT} command.  


A listing for ALL elements, i.e. not only the selected, can be obtained
with the command  
\begin{verbatim}
EPRINT, FULL=TRUE;
\end{verbatim} 
In that case, the SELECT command has no effect.
