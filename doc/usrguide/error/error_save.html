<h1>ESAVE: Save Machine Imperfections and read back from file</h1>

<br>
<b>Writing errors to a file:</b>
<br>
This command saves a table of errors assigned to elements on a file,
using a format which can be read in again to obtain the same results.
This allows dumping the errors and reloading them after a new USE command.
The range for these elements has to be specified.
An error save is requested by the statement
<pre>
ESAVE,FILE=string;
</pre>
<font COLOR="#ff0000">
<pre>
Example: 

SELECT,FLAG=ERROR,RANGE=range,CLASS=name,PATTERN=string;
ESAVE,FILE=err.file;
</pre>
</font>
and elements selected by the 
<a href="../Introduction/select.html">SELECT</a> command are saved to the file.
<br>
<br>
To save the errors of all elements to a file, one can use:
<font COLOR="#ff0000">
<br>
<pre>
SELECT,FLAG=ERROR,FULL;                                    
ESAVE,FILE=err.file;
</pre>
</font>
<br>
<br>
<b>Please note: in case of field errors, the absolute errors are saved and not relative errors. </b>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Setting errors from a table or file:</b>
<br>
To assign errors from a file is not a priori straightforward.
It may be required to re-assign existing errors after a <b>USE</b>
command was executed (which deletes all errors attached to a
sequence).
<br>
Errors stored in the form of an internal table (<i>errtab</i>) can 
be directly attached to the
appropriate positions in the sequence with the command:
<pre>
SETERR,TABLE=errtab;
</pre> 
The table <i>errtab</i> can be generated internally or from
an external file (<i>errfile</i>) with the generic command READMYTABLE.
<br>
The command sequence:
<pre>
READMYTABLE,file=errfile,table=errtab;
SETERR,TABLE=errtab;
</pre> 
reads the file <i>errfile</i> into the table <i>errtab</i> and
the command SETERR attaches the errors to the elements in
the active sequence.
<br>
The file <i>errfile</i> can be produced by a preceding ESAVE command
or any other utility. It should follow the format of a file generated
with ESAVE (see example program).
<br>
<b>Please note:  </b>
<br>
1. To assign correctly the errors from the file to the elements in the sequence,
all elements must have individual names, otherwise an identification is not possible.
Elements in the file not identified in the active sequence are ignored.
<br>
2. Errors are assigned to ALL elements found in the file and the FLAG=ERROR is set.
Therefore the number of elements selected corresponding to a command like: <br>
SELECT, FLAG=ERROR,...;<br>
can be different after the execution of SETERR.
