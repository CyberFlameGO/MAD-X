<h1>Field Errors</h1>

Field errors can be entered as relative or absolute errors.
Different multipole components can be specified with
different kinds of errors (relative or absolute).
Relations between absolute and relative field errors are listed below.
<p>
<font COLOR="#00ff00">
In MAD8 two commands were used for that purpose: EFIELD and EFCOMP.
Only EFCOMP was implemented in MAD-X since it provides the full
functionality of EFIELD and there was no need for duplication.
</font>
<p>
All field errors are specified as the integrated value
int(<i>K*ds</i>) of the <a href="../Introduction/sign_convent.html">field components</A>
along the magnet axis in m<sup>-i</sup>.
There is no provision to specify a global relative
excitation error affecting all field components in a combined function
magnet.
Such an error may only be entered by defining the same relative error
for all field components.
<p>
Field errors can be specified for all magnetic elements
by the statement
<pre>
SELECT,FLAG=ERROR,RANGE=range,CLASS=name,PATTERN=string;
EFCOMP, ORDER:=integer,RADIUS:=real,
        DKN:={dkn(0),dkn(1),dkn(2),...},
        DKS:={dks(0),dks(1),dks(2),...},
        DKNR:={dknr(0),dknr(1),dknr(2),...},
        DKSR:={dksr(0),dksr(1),dksr(2),...};
</pre>
and elements are now selected by the <a href="../Introduction/select.html">SELECT</A> command.
Each new <a name=efcomp>EFCOMP</A> statement
replaces the field errors for all elements in its range (s).
Any old field errors present in the range are discarded
or incremented depending on the setting of 
<a href="error_option.html">EOPTION,ADD</A>.
EFCOMP defines them in terms of relative or absolute components.
<p>
The attributes are:
<p>ORDER:
If relative errors are entered for multipoles,
this defines the order of the base component to which the relative 
errors refer.
This reference strength <i>k<sub>ref</sub></i> always refers to the normal component.
To use a skew component as the reference the reference radius
should be specified as a negative number.
The default is zero.
<br>
<font COLOR="#ff0000">
Please note that this implies to specify <i>k<sub>0</sub></i> to assign
relative field errors to a bending magnet since <i>k<sub>0</sub></i> is used
for the normalization and NOT the ANGLE.
</font>
<p>RADIUS:
Radius <i>R</i> were dknr(i) or dksr(i) are specified for 0...i...20 (default 1 m).
This attribute is required if dknr(i) or dksr(i) are specified.
If <i>R</i> is negativ, the skew component is used for the reference strength.
<p>DKN(i):
Absolute error for the normal multipole strength with (2i+2) poles
(default: 0  m<sup>-i</sup>).
<p>DKS(i):
Absolute error for the skewed multipole strength with (2i+2) poles
(default: 0  m<sup>-i</sup>).
<p>DKNR(i):
Relative error for the normal multipole strength with (2i+2) poles
(default: 0  m<sup>-i</sup>).
<p>DKSR(i):
Relative error for the skewed multipole strength with (2i+2) poles
(default: 0  m<sup>-i</sup>).
<p>
<br>
<br>
<b>Time memory effects:</b>
<br>
The relative errors can be corrected for possible time memory effects.
A correction term is computed and added to the relative error.
<br>
The correction term is parametrized as a 3rd order polynomial in the 
reference strength <i>k<sub>ref</sub></i> according to:
<br>
<br>
<pre>
Delta = sum (c<sub>i</sub> * <i>k<sup>i</sup><sub>ref</sub></i>)            i = 0,..3
</pre>
<br>
The coefficients c<sub>i</sub> for the polynominal must be supplied in the command.
<br>
<br>
Two additional parameters and options are required:
<br>
<p>HYSTER: if it is set to 1 applies the correction term derived from the reference
strength and the coefficients.
<br>
<p>HCOEFFN and HCOEFFS: coefficients (normal and skew) for the computation of
the correction term. The 4 coefficients are specified in increasing order, starting
with the 0th order. Each group of four coefficients is valid for one order of
the field errors. Trailing zeros can be omitted, preceding zeros must be given.

<br>
<br>
<br>
Example 1 (assign relative errors to quadrupoles);
<pre>
select, flag=error, pattern="q.*";
efcomp, order:=1, radius:=0.010,
dknr:={0,4e-1,1e-1,2e-3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
dksr:={0,4e-1,1e-1,2e-3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0};
</pre>
<br>
<br>
Example 2 (add time memory effect to relative errors):
<pre>
select, flag=error, pattern="^q.*";
efcomp, order=1, radius=0.020, hyster=1,
hcoeffn:={0.000,0.000,0.000,0.000,   // coefficients multipole order 0
          0.001,0.000,0.000,0.000,   // coefficients multipole order 1
          0.000,0.000,0.002,0.000},  // coefficients multipole order 2
dknr:={0,1e-2,2e-4,4e-5,1e-5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
dksr:={0,1e-2,2e-4,4e-5,1e-5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0};
