<h2><a name=sxf>SXF file input and output</a></h2>
The command
<pre>
SXFWRITE,FILE=filename;
</pre>
writes the currently (i.e. last) USEd sequence with all alignment
and field errors in <a
href="../Introduction/bibliography.html#SXF">[SXF]</a> format onto the
file specified. This then represents one "instance" of the sequence,
where all parameters are given by numbers rather than expressions; the
file can be read by other programs to get a complete picture of the
sequence.
<p>
The command
<pre>
SXFREAD,FILE=filename;
</pre>
reads a file in SXF format, stores the sequence away and USEs it(!) in order
to keep the existing errors. The following does therefore work:
<p>
Example:
<pre>
job 1:

! define sequence MYSEQU

use,mysequ;

! add alignment errors and field errors

sxfwrite,file=file;
stop;

job 2:

sxfread,file=file;
twiss;
stop;
