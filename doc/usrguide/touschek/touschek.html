<h2>TOUSCHEK: Touschek Lifetime and Scattering Rates</h2>
</center>

<P>The TOUSCHEK module computes the Touschek lifetime and the scattering rates 
around a lepton or hadron storage ring, based on the formalism of Piwinski [A. 
Piwinski, &quot;The Touschek Effect in Strong Focusing Storage Rings,&quot; DESY-98-179; 
see also Piwinski's article on Touschek lifetime in the Handbook of Accelerator 
Physics and Engineering (A. Chao, M. Tigner, eds.), World Scientific, 1999] .</P>
<P>The syntax of the TOUSCHEK command is: </P><PRE>TOUSCHEK, FILE;
</PRE>TOUSCHEK should be called after a TWISS command. One or several cavities 
with rf voltages should be defined prior to calling TWISS and TOUSCHEK. 
[Warning: Calling EMIT between the TWISS and TOUSCHEK commands leads to TOUSCHEK using wrong beam parameters, even if the BEAM command is reiterated.]
<p>The momentum acceptance is taken from the bucket size taking into account the 
energy loss per turn <i>U0 </i>from synchrotron radiation. The value of <i>U0</i> 
is computed from the second synchrotron radiation integral <i>synch_2</i> in the 
TWISS summ table (<i>synch_2</i> is calculated only when the TWISS option 'chrom' 
is invoked), using Eq. (3.61) in Matt Sands' report SLAC-121, which was 
generalized to the case of several harmonic rf systems. If <i>synch_2=0</i>, not 
defined, or not calculated, zero energy loss is assumed. </p>
<p>In the case of several&nbsp; rf systems with nonzero voltages, it is assumed 
that the lowest frequency system defines the phase of the outer point on the 
separatrix when calculating the momentum acceptance, and that all 
higher-harmonic systems are either in phase or in anti-phase to the lowest 
frequency system. (Note: if a storage rings really uses a different rf scheme, 
one would need to change the acceptance function in the routine <i>cavtousch </i>
for that ring.) <br>
&nbsp;</p>
<P>The arguments have the following meaning: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>FILE: The name of the output file (default: 'touschek') 
  </UL>
<P>Example: </P><PRE>BEAM,PARTICLE=PROTON,ENERGY=450,NPART=1.15e11,EX=7.82E-9,EY=7.82E-9,ET=5.302e-5,SIGE=7.164e-4,SIGT=0.1124,RADIATE=TRUE;

The first command defines the beam parameters. It is essential that the 
longitudinal emittances and bunch length are set. The command <I>use</I> selects the beam 
line or sequence. The next command assign a value to the cavity rf voltage vrf 
(example name). The <i>select</i> clear previous assignments to the <i>twiss </i>module,
<I>twiss 
</I>calculates and saves the values of all twiss parameters for all elements in 
the ring; the <i>touschek</i> command computes the Touschek lifetime and writes 
it to the file 'touschek' (default name). 
<P>The results are stored in the <I>TOUSCHEK </I>tables, and can be written to a 
file (with the default name 'touschek' in the example above), or values can be 
extracted from the table using the value command as follows </P>
<P>value,table(touschek,name),table(touschek,s),table(touschek,tli),table(touschek,tliw),table(touschek,tlitot); </P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">where 'name' denotes the name of a 
beamline element, <i>s</i> the position of the center of the element,<i> tli</i> 
the instanteneous Touschek loss rate within the element, and <i>tliw</i> the 
instantaneous rate weighted by the length of the element divided by the 
circumference (its contribution to the total loss rate), and<i> tlitot </i>the 
accumulated loss rate adding the rates over all beamline elements through the 
present position. The value of <i>tlitot</i> at the end of the beamline is the 
inverse of the Touschek lifetime in units of 1/s.</font></P>
<P>Also, all results can be printed to a file using the command </P>
<P>write,table=touschek,file;</P>
