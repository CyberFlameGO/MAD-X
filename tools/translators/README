Here we start the project of SAD <-> MAD-X translators.

2017, Mar.01:
1) New examples for lattice translation are added. Check the READMEs for further 
  information in each sub-directory.
2) Note that the examples are for the users' references when they want to do translations
  for their own projects.
3) If there are possible copyright violations somewhere in these examples, please feel 
  free to contact dmzhou@post.kek.jp.
