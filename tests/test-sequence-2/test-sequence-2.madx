 * PS BOOSTER. Directory: /afs/cern.ch/eng/ps/cps/Psb
 * It consists of 16 identical periods, apart from the equipment
 * in the straight sections.
 * The BOOSTER has a radius of 25m and thus a circonference of 157.08m
 *
 * The injected beam from the linac have Ekin=50 MeV proton beam with p~300MeV/c.
 * (311 MeV/c according to the report: http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/p05/PAPERS/TPAT054.PDF)
 * corresponding to E=0.988471 GeV and E0=0.938272 GeV. (The rest mass of a proton is 0.938272 GeV)
 *
 * The kinetic energy of the extracted beam is Ekin=1.4 GeV and p=2.141766 GeV/c [p=(SQRT(Ekin^2+2*E0*Ekin)/c]
 * The beam is extracted to the PS. In the PS, it is injected in SS42.
 *
 *
 * Revolution time at extraction:  T,revolution,ext = 572.79 ns (nano  seconds)
 * Revolution time at injection:   T,revolution,inj =   1.6  us (micro seconds)
 * The BOOSTER today has 2 bunches in each ring, i.e. 8 bunches in the PS.
 * Injection time: C=275 ms, measure time C=290 ms
 *
 * Working points:
 * Injection - high intensity          : QX=4.28,  QY=4.55
 * Injection - low  intensity e.g. LHC : QX=4.28,  QY=4.45
 * Extraction                          : QX=4.172, QY=4.23   = wp1
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * The 2 MHz cavities are for the H0 mode, they are run around 8kV.
 * They are run at the revolution frequency.
 * The beam is below transition.
 *
 * The 4 MHz cavities are used to flatten the bunches.
 * They reduce the peak current compared to the average currents.
 * The 4 MHz cavities are run between 6-8 kV.
 * They are run at twice the revolution frequency.
 *
 *
 * All elements in the straight sections added.  21 Dec 2006 O.Berrig
 * New working point: QX = 4.172 and QY = 4.23.  21 Dec 2006 O.Berrig
