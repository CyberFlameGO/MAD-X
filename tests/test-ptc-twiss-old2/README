PTC_TWISS Example2 for the task of the matching between 
a ring and a transferline.

Run command:
../madxp < example2.madx [ > example2.out ]

with the Mad-X output directed to the terminal or to the "*.out" file.

In this example, the PTC_TWISS command is applied to calculate 
the Ripken-style parameters along the transferline using Twiss 
parameters of the ring at its end as the initial conditions.

Example2 demonstrates an external ("manual") input of the 
initial conditions. The Twiss parameters at the end of ring 
are given as arguments of the PTC_TWISS command-line with 
the following PTC_TWISS command:

  PTC_TWISS,icase=5,no=1, betx=177,bety=32,alfx=-2.4,alfy=0.4,
             dx=2.1,dpx=0.02,mux=1.2, muy=1.25, x=8.8E-05,
             px=7.2E-07,y=5.25E-05,py=-6.7E-07, 
                                       file=twiss_ptc_line;
