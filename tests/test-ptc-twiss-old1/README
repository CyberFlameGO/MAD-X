PTC_TWISS Example1 for the task of the matching between 
a ring and a transferline.

Run command:
../madxp < example1.madx [> example1.out]

with the Mad-X output directed to the terminal or to 
the "*.out" file.

In this example, the PTC_TWISS command is applied to calculate 
the Ripken-style parameters along the transferline using Twiss 
parameters of the ring at its end as the initial conditions.

Example1 demonstrates an internal ("automatic") method for 
the input of the initial conditions. The Twiss parameters
at the end of ring are transfered by means of the BETA0-block 
(named as "TWSSip") with the following PTC_TWISS command:

  PTC_TWISS,icase=5,no=1,BETA0=TWSSip,file=twiss_ptc_line;
