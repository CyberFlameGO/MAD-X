hort run with five fodo cells:

Date: 15.09.2005

Run command:
madx < fv9.madx >! fv9.out
 
Special tasks:

a.) Twiss parameters calculated at the center of the element.
b.) The internal table "my_table" is used as a twiss table ergo this name
    is used in the "select" command.
c.) The components of the one-turn map, at the location of each element, here
    just re11, re12, re13, re14, are written to the twiss output file. 
d.) The cumulative sectormaps are written at the center of the drifts to the 
    sectorfile = "my_sectorfile".

run output:       fv9.out
twiss output:     twiss_fv9
sectormap output: my_sectorfile

Comment V2.00: sector map has been corrected for closed orbit error
Comment V3.00.00: 1) Results are now closer again to those of V2.10 and earlier.
                  For unknown reasons old executable do not reproduce the
                  bad results.
                  2) Results are different since the center option was incorrect
                  before when a closed orbit was present.
