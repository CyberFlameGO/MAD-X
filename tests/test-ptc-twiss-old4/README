PTC_TWISS Example4 for the task of the matching between 
a ring and a transferline.

Run command:
../madxp < example4.madx [> example4.out]

with the Mad-X output directed to the terminal or to the "*.out" file.

In this example, the PTC_TWISS command is applied to calculate 
the Ripken-style parameters along the transferline. 
A transfer matrix  is used as initial conditions.

Example4 demonstrates an external ("manual") input of the 
initial conditions. The elements of the transfer matrix are 
are given as arguments of the PTC_TWISS command with the 
following PTC_TWISS command:

ptc_twiss,icase=5,no=1,initial_matrix_manual,              
    re11=-2.4,   re12=176.,   re13=0.23E-01, re14=1.06,          re16=2.3,
    re21=-.3E-01,re22=2.3,    re23=0.59E-03, re24=0.2E-01,       re26=0.4E-01,
    re31=-.1E-01,re32=1.1,    re33=0.44,     re34=32.7,          re36=0.23E-02,
    re41=-.1E-03,re42=0.1E-01,re43=-.3E-01,  re44=-.535,         re46=-.9E-03,
