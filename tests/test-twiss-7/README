            Test of the TILT option for the EMIT module
            *******************************************

To check that TILT is properly used in the EMIT module 
the example defines the lattice elements as skew quadrupoles 
and sextupoles with tilts of pi/4 amd pi/6, respectively, 
which correspond exactly to normal quadrupoles and sextupoles. 
The result therefore should be the same as for the normal 
lattice with normal elements, and this is indeed the case.
EMIT treats TILTs in the proper way.
