!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! This file contains the definition of the sequences used for Matching of TLEP (FCC-ee) Version 11.
! It has to be used as an input file for the main TLEP MADX programme.
! - The definiton of the sequences corresponds to TLEP Version 10.
! - There are slight differences of the cayity positions (they are now at 0.25 * cell length)
!   and the BPMs and Correctors in the final doublet are removed.
! - Lattice definition now as SEQUENCE, not as a LINE!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
