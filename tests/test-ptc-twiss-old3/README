PTC_TWISS Example3 for the task of the matching between 
a ring and a transferline.

Run command:
../madxp < example3.madx [> example3.out]

with the Mad-X output directed to the terminal or to the "*.out" file.

In this example, the PTC_TWISS command is applied to calculate 
the Ripken-style parameters along the transferline. A transfer matrix 
generated from the one-turn map-table produced at the ring end by the 
previous PTC_NORMAL-command is used as initial conditions.

Example3 demonstrates an internal ("automatic") method for 
the input of the transfer matrix. The matrix is accepted by the 
PTC_TWISS command due to the option "initial_matrix_table": 

  PTC_TWISS,icase=5,no=1,initial_matrix_table, file=twiss_ptc_line;
