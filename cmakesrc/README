CMake:

 CMake is a build tool that can be used instead of make. 
 In principle it can also be used on Windows, however we do not 
 currently aim to support this. We do try to support all linux 
 flavours in addition to Mac OSX.

 Basic usage:
 Create a temporary folder and enter it in terminal. Write the command
  cmake <path to source>
 You can then build mad-x with
  make
 If you wish, you can use "-j <nprocs>" to utilise several processors for faster compilation.
 If you wish, you can use "VERBOSE=yes" to see all commands that are used, e.g. for making sure you use the correct flags and compiler.
 If you wish to edit something in your current build configuration, you can use the command
  ccmake .
 Inside there, you can toggle advanced mode with "t", edit an option with "c", and quit with "q"
 In order to use a different compiler, you can use instead of the first command
  cmake -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=ifort <path to source>
 This is general for all options, -D<option>=value will automatically set this option.
 If you want to use the NAG compiler, please use -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=nagfor, not f95 (which is usually just a link to your default fortran compiler..)
 
 OSX specific:
 On OSX you can build a binary for multiple architectures. This requires that your compilers are built with the universal option on (e.g. for macports: "port install gcc +universal")
 You can compile for multiple architectures with the flag CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES, so e.g. 
    cmake -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="i386;x86_64" <srcdir>

 In case of LF95:
  lf95 can only build 32bit executables. If you want to use this compiler on a 64bit system, please use the initial command:
    cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<path-to-source>/LinuxLF95.cmake <path-to-source>
  This is so far only known to work with CMake newer than or equal to version 2.8.1. That means it will not work on lxplus at the moment. For a 32bit system the compiler can be used in the usual way, with the option "-DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=lf95"
