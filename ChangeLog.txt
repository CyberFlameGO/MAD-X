1. Fixed bug(s) in quantum radiation: Incorrect initialization of
  variables; Error in the calculation of rfac.
2. Tracking option 'damp' was not implemented in the thick-quadrupole,
thick-dipole, rf-multipole. Now it's there.

   ptc_twiss: fix of issue TRAC #417 (big slow down of ptc_twiss in high order): 
   converted 6D dispersion calculation to matrices instead of taylor maps, 
   which were extremely slow at high orders

 1. ptc_twiss with time=TRUE: scaling of dispersions and chromaticities with
    relativistic beta such that they are the same as with time=false and in case of non-relativistic energies.
    This correction is NOT implemented for the values in NONLIN table where the raw values calculated by ptc are stored.
    With time=TRUE the longitudinal variables are dE/E and dT/T (energy and time offsets). Therefore the chromatic
    functions are calculated with respect of these variables. For linear variables the conversion is straight forward
    so implemented it for variables going to twiss and summ tables (and terminal) to meet average user expectations. 
    On the other hand, the conversion of the higher orders that are present in the NONLIN table is very cumbersome,
    so the user needs to understand it and eventually rung with time=FALSE.
 2. Cleaned higher order compaction factor calculation. These outomatically pop out from PTC for icase=56 and time=FALSE.
    There was a bug related to change of definition in new PTC for normal_form%A1 variable and it is corrected with this commit.
    In the code there were algorithms implemented for other cases, however, I discovered that they were failing for extreme situations
    like very low energy and/or calculation at high dispersion point. Therefore, I removed them so alpha_c_p, alpha_c_p2
    and alpha_c_p3 are calculated only for icase=56 time=FALSE

    Fixed bug #402 (T and PT not checked if within user specified box).
    Added check of all coordinates with exception of T in case of totalpath=true, 
    in which case it prints an info. Added rootntuple option to ptc_track command what allows to save 
    all the data to ROOT ntuple; For think RF cavity added LAG adjustment in MADX to PTC translation such that 
    particles with zero T coordinate has no net acceleration in a cavity with LAG=0

    Bug fix to get Hamiltonian terms from ptc_normal with the new PTC; 
    ptc_twiss does not fill EIGN vectors as now these columns are for sigma matrix;
