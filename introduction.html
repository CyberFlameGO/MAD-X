<h1>Introduction</h1>
<hr class="h1">
<!-- <p class="newyear"> -->

<p>
MAD-X is a project with a long history, aiming to be at the forefront of computational physics in the field of particle accelerator design and simulation. Its scripting language is <em>de facto</em> the standard to describe particle accelerators, simulate beam dynamics and optimize beam optics at CERN.

<p>
MAD-X is the successor of MAD-8 and was first released in June, 2002. It offers most of the MAD-8 functionalities, with some additions, corrections, and extensions. The most important of these extensions is the Polymorphic Tracking Code (PTC) of E. Forest (see <a href="documentation.html">documentation</a>).

<!--
<p>
PTC includes the FPP package which overloads the LBNL version of Berz package and The Lingyun Yang C++ TPSA package for differential algebra computation. The user can select which package he wants to use at run time.
-->

<p>
MAD-X is released for the Linux, Mac OS X and Windows platforms for 32 bit (on demand) and 64 bit architectures (see <a href="releases.html">releases</a>). The source code is written in C, C++, Fortan77 and Fortran90.

<h3>MAD support</h3>

<p>
The users support is provided through the e-group <a href="mailto:mad-usr@cern.ch">mad-usr</a>, or directly by emailing to <a href="mailto:mad@cern.ch?subject=[MAD]">mad support</a>. For questions or bug report, you must provide a <em>clear description and a self contained minimalistic example</em> that exhibits the unexpected behavior with the <em>last release</em> (see <a href="support.html">support</a>).

<p>
The project support and maintainance strategy is based on the MAD team and collaborators to debug and improve the legacy code (see <a href="contributors.html">contributors</a>). This task can become pretty complicated when dealing with the legacy code, and finding effective correction can take a significant amount of time (see <a href="support.html">support</a>).
