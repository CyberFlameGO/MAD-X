<h3>MAD-X issues</h3>

<p>
The <a href="http://github.com/MethodicalAcceleratorDesign/MAD-X/issues" onclick="target='_top'">issue tracker</a> allows to follow-up defect reports and feature requests efficiently.

<p>
Each bug report or feature request sent to <a href="mailto:mad-usr@cern.ch">mad-usr</a>, <a href="mailto:mad-dev@cern.ch">mad-dev</a> or <a href="mailto:mad@cern.ch?subject=[MAD%20ISSUE]">mad support</a> will be loaded into the system, get a ticket number, assigned to a module keeper or a MAD team member (see <a href="contributors.html">contributors</a>), and the reporter will be added to the notification list for follow-up. Users can also setup issues by themselves directly on the system.

<p>
Report should always come with a <b>clear description of the problem</b> as well as a <b>self contained minimalistic script example using small lattices</b> that exhibits the described unexpected behavior with the <b>last release</b> (see <a href="releases.html">releases</a>), otherwise the <b>bug report might not be processed</b>.
